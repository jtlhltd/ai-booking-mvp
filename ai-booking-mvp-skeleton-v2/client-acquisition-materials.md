```
Subject: 300% More Appointments for [Practice Name]?

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Practice Name] has been growing - that's fantastic! 

But I'm curious: how many potential patients are you losing because they can't book appointments outside business hours?

Most dental practices miss 40-60% of booking opportunities because:
- Patients call when you're closed
- Staff are busy with patients during calls
- Manual scheduling creates errors

Our AI booking system has helped practices like yours:
‚úÖ Increase bookings by 300%
‚úÖ Reduce no-shows by 50%
‚úÖ Free up staff time for patient care

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see how this could work for [Practice Name]?

Best regards,
[Your Name]

P.S. We're offering a free 30-day trial with no setup fees for the first 10 practices this month.

Subject: Automate Client Intake for [Firm Name]?

Hi [Name],

I saw [Firm Name] handles [practice area] cases - impressive work!

Quick question: How much time does your team spend on initial client consultations and intake?

Most law firms we work with spend 2-3 hours per day just on:
- Scheduling consultations
- Qualifying leads
- Following up with prospects

Our AI system automates this entire process:
‚úÖ Books consultations 24/7
‚úÖ Qualifies leads automatically
‚úÖ Follows up with prospects
‚úÖ Integrates with your calendar

[Firm Name] could save 10+ hours per week while booking more consultations.

Worth a 15-minute conversation?

### Template 3: Beauty Salon Outreach
```
Subject: Stop Double Bookings at [Salon Name]?

Hi [Name],

I love what [Salon Name] is doing with [specific service/trend]!

But I'm curious: how often do you deal with double bookings or last-minute cancellations?

Most salons lose 20-30% of revenue due to:
- Double bookings from manual scheduling
- No-shows with no follow-up
- Staff spending time on phone instead of clients

Our AI booking system eliminates these issues:
‚úÖ Prevents double bookings
‚úÖ Reduces no-shows by 60%
‚úÖ Books appointments 24/7
‚úÖ Sends automatic reminders

[Salon Name] could increase revenue by 25% while improving customer experience.
