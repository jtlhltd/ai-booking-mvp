## 📞 **DISCOVERY CALL SCRIPT:**

### **Opening (2 minutes):**
> "Hi [Name], thanks for taking my call. I understand you're interested in our AI lead conversion service. Before we dive in, let me ask: how many leads are you currently getting per month?"

**Listen for:** 50-500+ leads/month = good fit

### **Qualifying Questions (5 minutes):**

1. **"Where are these leads coming from?"**
   - Facebook ads
   - Google ads
   - Website forms
   - Referrals
   - Events
   - *(Confirms they have a lead source)*

2. **"What's your current process for following up with them?"**
   - Manual calling
   - Email only
   - No systematic follow-up
   - *(Identifies the pain point)*

3. **"What percentage of leads actually become appointments?"**
   - <10% = huge opportunity
   - 10-20% = typical, can improve
   - >20% = already good, harder sell
   - *(Sets baseline for improvement)*

4. **"What's the average value of a new customer to you?"**
   - £50-100 = might not be worth it
   - £100-500 = perfect fit
   - £500+ = high-value, easy ROI
   - *(Determines pricing tier)*

5. **"How quickly do you typically follow up with new leads?"**
   - Same day = good but could be better
   - 24-48 hours = losing deals
   - 3+ days = massive opportunity
   - *(Highlights speed advantage)*

### **Pitch (3 minutes):**
> "Based on what you've told me, here's how we can help:
> 
> You're getting [X] leads per month and converting [Y]%. That means you're losing [Z] potential customers.
> 
> Here's what we do:
> 1. You send us your leads (CSV, API, or email forward)
> 2. Our AI calls them within 15 minutes
> 3. We follow up 3-5 times until they respond
> 4. We book appointments into your calendar
> 5. We send confirmations and reminders
> 
> Result: We typically convert 30-40% of leads. For you, that means [calculation] more appointments per month.
> 
> At your average deal value of £[X], that's £[Y] more revenue.
> 
> Our fee is £799/month for up to 500 leads.
> 
> So you'd spend £799 and make an extra £[Y]. That's a [Z]x return."

### **Close (5 minutes):**
> "Want to try it? Here's what I suggest:
> 
> 1. Send me your last 50 leads
> 2. We'll run a test campaign this week
> 3. I'll show you the results Friday
> 4. If you get at least 10 appointments, we continue
> 5. If not, you don't pay anything
> 
> Fair?"

**If yes:**
- [ ] Send intake form immediately

### **Issue: Calendar connection fails**
**Solution:**
- Use direct calendar link
- Screen share and walk through setup

### **Issue: Client wants complex customization**
**Solution:**
- "Great idea! Let's get basic version running this week, then customize next week"
- Start simple, iterate later
- 80/20 rule: Basic setup gets 80% results

### **Issue: Test campaign doesn't perform well**
**Solution:**
- Check lead quality: "Are these recent leads or old ones?"
