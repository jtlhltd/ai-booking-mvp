## 📝 EMAIL TEMPLATES

### Email 1: Introduction
**Subject:** Quick question about [Business Name]'s lead follow-up

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Business Name] has a strong online presence. Quick question - are you currently following up with all your leads within 5 minutes?

Most businesses lose 50-70% of their leads because staff are too busy to call back quickly.

I help businesses like yours convert more leads into booked appointments using AI-powered follow-up - so you never miss an opportunity.

Worth a quick 15-minute call to see if this could work for [Business Name]?

### Email 2: Social Proof (Day 3 - IF OPENED Email 1)
**Subject:** How a local business booked 12 extra appointments last month

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Following up on my message about lead conversion.

I just helped a business similar to [Business Name] book 12 extra appointments last month by following up with their existing leads within 5 minutes.

They were losing 60% of their leads before we started working together.

Here's what we did:
• AI calls every lead within 5 minutes of inquiry
• Persistent follow-up (most leads need 3-5 touches)
• Appointments booked directly into their calendar
• They just show up to close the deals

The owner told me: "I didn't realize how many leads were slipping through the cracks until we started tracking it."

Would you be interested in a quick case study showing the exact results?

### Email 2B: Different Angle (Day 3 - IF NOT OPENED Email 1)
**Subject:** Are you losing leads to competitors?

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Quick question: When someone fills out a contact form on your website at 7pm, do they get a response within 5 minutes?

If not, they're probably booking with a competitor.

Studies show:
• 78% of customers buy from the first responder
• 50% of leads go to whoever responds first
• Most businesses lose 60-70% of leads due to slow follow-up

I help businesses like [Business Name] convert more leads by responding immediately (even outside business hours).

Worth a quick 15-minute call?

### Email 5: Urgency (Day 14)
**Subject:** Last chance - free trial ending soon

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

This is my final email about the lead conversion service.

I'm limiting free trials to 5 businesses this month, and I have 2 spots left.

If you're interested in booking 8-12 extra appointments per month without any extra work, reply with "INTERESTED" and I'll send you a case study.

Otherwise, I'll stop following up and assume it's not a priority right now.

Best,
