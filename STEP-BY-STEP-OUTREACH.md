## ✅ STEP 9: Set Your Daily Goal (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Define your outreach volume

## 💡 KEY MINDSET TIP

**Don't aim for perfection on the first try.**

You'll get better at:
- Finding prospects (faster)
- Personalizing messages (better)
- Getting responses (improved messaging)

**But you only learn by DOING.** Your first 100 outreach will be slower than your next 100.

**Focus on CONSISTENCY over PERFECTION.**
