# 🎯 ADDING CTAs TO YOUR INSTANTLY EMAILS
## Fix Your 77% Open Rate → Turn It Into Replies!

---

## 🚨 THE PROBLEM

**Your situation:**
- ✅ **77% open rate** = AMAZING (people are reading!)
- ❌ **2.9% reply rate** = Low (people can't respond easily)
- ❌ **No CTA/link** = People don't know what to do next

**What's happening:**
1. They open your email (77% do!)
2. They read it
3. They think "Sounds interesting..."
4. **But there's no clear next step**
5. They close it and forget

**The fix:** Add a clear CTA (call-to-action) or link!

---

## ✅ WHY CTAs MATTER

**Without CTA:**
- People read → Think "maybe later" → Forget
- Reply rate: **2-3%**

**With CTA:**
- People read → See clear action → Click/Reply
- Reply rate: **5-10%** (2-3x higher!)

**Your 77% open rate = Gold mine if you add CTAs!**

## 📧 COMPLETE EMAIL TEMPLATE WITH CTA

### **Email 1 (Initial):**

```
Hi {{firstName}},

Quick question: How do you handle lead follow-up at {{company}}?

Most salons I speak with get 20-30 leads/month from Google Ads/website, but only follow up with half because they're busy with clients.

I help salons like yours automate this:
• Call leads within 5 minutes (AI-powered)
• Follow up 5-7 times automatically (calls + SMS)
• Book appointments directly into your calendar
• You just show up and treat the client

Most salons see 8-12 extra appointments per month.

Worth a quick 10-min chat?

[Book a call: Your Calendar Link]

Or just reply "YES" and I'll send you a quick demo.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Your Phone]

P.S. - This isn't lead generation. I work with YOUR existing leads from your ads/website.
```

---

### **Email 2 (Follow-Up Day 3):**

```
Hi {{firstName}},

Following up on my email from Monday.

I get it - you're busy with clients. That's exactly the problem, right?

Here's what's happening:
• Every day, 2-3 leads come in from your Google Ads
• Your staff tries to call them back when they can
• But by then (1-2 hours later), 50% have already called another salon
• The leads you DO reach, you only call once or twice before giving up

Meanwhile, I call within 5 minutes, follow up 5-7 times, and convert 30-40% of leads that would otherwise be wasted.

FREE TRIAL: Give me 10 leads this week. If I book 3+, we continue. If not, no charge.

Ready to try it?

[Book a call: Your Calendar Link]

Or reply "YES" and I'll send you the onboarding form.

[Your Name]
```

---

### **Email 3 (Final Day 7):**

```
Hi {{firstName}},

Last email - I'll assume you're not interested after this.

But before I move on, let me leave you with this thought:

You're spending money on Google Ads to get leads.
Then losing 50-70% of them because you can't follow up fast enough.

That's wasted ad spend every month.

My fee is £500/month to fix this. Most salons see £1,200-1,800 in extra revenue.

If you change your mind: [Your Calendar Link]

Otherwise, best of luck with {{company}}!

[Your Name]

P.S. - If it's not the right time now, when would be better? Sometimes January or September are better for big changes.

## 🎯 CTA BEST PRACTICES

### **DO:**
✅ **Make it clear** ("Book a call", "Reply YES")
✅ **Make it easy** (One click or one word)
✅ **Make it urgent** ("Worth a quick chat?", "Ready to try it?")
✅ **Give options** (Calendar link OR reply)
✅ **Add to signature** (Phone number for trust)

### **DON'T:**
❌ **Be vague** ("Let me know if interested")
❌ **Make it hard** ("Fill out this 10-question form")
❌ **Be pushy** ("Book NOW or miss out!")
❌ **Multiple CTAs** (One clear action only)

---

## 📊 TRACKING YOUR CTAs

**Instantly will track:**
- ✅ **Clicks** on calendar links
- ✅ **Replies** (if they reply "YES")
- ✅ **Opens** (you already have 77%!)

**What to watch:**
- **Click rate:** Target 5-10% (people clicking your link)
- **Reply rate:** Target 5-10% (people replying)
- **Combined:** 10-20% total engagement (clicks + replies)

**With your 77% open rate:**
- 100 emails sent
- 77 opens
- 5-15 clicks/replies
- **Much better than 2.9%!**

---

## 🚀 QUICK FIX (5 MINUTES)

### **Right Now:**

1. **Open Instantly** → Campaigns → Your campaign
2. **Edit Email 1** → Scroll to bottom
3. **Add this:**
   ```
   Worth a quick 10-min chat?
   
   [Your Calendar Link]
   
   Or reply "YES" for a demo.
   
   [Your Name]
   [Your Phone]
   ```
4. **Save** → Do same for Email 2 & 3
5. **Done!**

**This will likely DOUBLE your reply rate!**

---

## 💡 WHY THIS WILL WORK

**Your situation:**
- ✅ **77% open rate** = People are interested
- ✅ **Good subject lines** (they're opening!)
- ✅ **Good content** (they're reading!)
- ❌ **No clear action** = They don't know what to do

**After adding CTAs:**
- People open (77%)
- They read (they already do)
- **They see clear action** (CTA)
- **They click/reply** (5-10% instead of 2.9%)

**Expected result:**
- **Current:** 2.9% reply rate
- **After CTA:** 5-10% reply rate
- **That's 2-3x more replies!**

## ✅ ACTION PLAN

### **Today (5 mins):**
1. Get calendar link (Calendly/Cal.com) OR use "Reply YES" CTA
2. Add CTA to all 3 emails in Instantly
3. Save campaign

### **This Week:**
1. Monitor click rate (should be 5-10% of opens)
2. Monitor reply rate (should go from 2.9% to 5-10%)
3. Test different CTAs (calendar link vs "Reply YES")

### **Next Week:**
1. If click rate low → Try softer CTA ("Quick question..." opener)
2. If reply rate still low → Check targeting (right people?)
3. Keep testing!

## 🎯 BOTTOM LINE

**Your 77% open rate is AMAZING!**

**But without a CTA:**
- People read → Think "maybe later" → Forget
- You're wasting 77% of your opens!

**With a CTA:**
- People read → See action → Click/Reply
- You convert 5-10% of opens into replies
- **That's 2-3x more replies!**

**Fix:** Add a clear CTA (calendar link or "Reply YES") to all emails.

**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Impact:** 2-3x reply rate  
**ROI:** HUGE
