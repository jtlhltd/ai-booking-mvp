5. PRICING HANDLING:

8. CONNECTION ISSUES:
   - If line is poor: "I'm sorry, the line seems a bit unclear. Can you hear me okay?"

## Updated First Message

Replace your VAPI assistant's first message with:

```
"Hello, this is Sarah from AI Booking Solutions. I hope I'm not catching you at a bad time? I'm calling to help businesses like yours with appointment booking. Do you have a couple of minutes to chat about this?"

## Key Changes for SMS Pipeline:

1. **Added SMS Pipeline Handoff**: When leads show interest, mention texting them
2. **Natural Flow**: "I'll text you at this number with next steps"

## Integration Points:

- **Cold Call** → Lead shows interest
- **Bot says**: "I'll text you at this number with next steps"
- **SMS sent** → "Hi [Name], thanks for your interest! Please reply with your email address so I can send you the demo booking link"
- **Lead replies** → Email address received
- **Email sent** → Confirmation + booking link
- **Calendar booked** → Demo scheduled

This creates a seamless, professional pipeline from cold call to booked demo!
