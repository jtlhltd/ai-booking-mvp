### Why This Matters:

Your headline appears:

### Bad Headlines (Generic):

```

## üìÑ STEP 3: ABOUT SECTION (Most Important!)

### Structure (4 Paragraphs):

**Paragraph 1:** The Problem (they relate)
**Paragraph 2:** Your Solution (how you fix it)
**Paragraph 3:** Results & Proof (credibility)
**Paragraph 4:** Call-to-Action (what to do next)

### Complete About Section Template:

```
Most businesses waste 50-70% of their leads.

Not because the leads are bad. But because:
‚Ä¢ Teams are too busy serving current customers to call back quickly
‚Ä¢ Most businesses only follow up 1-2 times before giving up
‚Ä¢ Leads fall through the cracks and book with competitors

I fix this with an AI-powered lead follow-up system.

Here's how it works:
‚úÖ I call YOUR leads within 5 minutes (while they're still interested)
‚úÖ Follow up 5-7 times via calls + SMS (persistent but professional)
‚úÖ Book appointments directly into your calendar (automated)
‚úÖ You focus on delivering your service (no extra work)

What you get:
‚Ä¢ Faster response time (5 minutes vs hours)
‚Ä¢ Consistent follow-up (5-7 touches vs 1-2)
‚Ä¢ Higher conversion (systematic vs ad-hoc)
‚Ä¢ Time saved (automated vs manual)
‚Ä¢ Done-for-you service (not software you have to learn)

‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
