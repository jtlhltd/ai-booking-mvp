# 🚫 HANDLING UNSUBSCRIBES - QUICK GUIDE

**Your 2.9% reply rate is GOOD!** But unsubscribes happen. Here's how to handle them professionally.

---

## ✅ WHY 2.9% REPLY RATE IS GOOD

**Industry benchmarks:**
- **1-3% reply rate** = Normal for cold email
- **3-5% reply rate** = Good (well-targeted, good messaging)
- **5-10% reply rate** = Excellent (rare)

**Your 2.9% = You're hitting the target!**

**Math:**
- 100 emails sent = 2.9 replies
- 1,000 emails sent = 29 replies
- 2,000 emails sent = 58 replies

**Keep scaling volume → More replies come!**

---

## 🚫 UNSUBSCRIBES ARE NORMAL

**Reality check:**
- **5-15% unsubscribe rate** is normal in cold email
- **Some people just don't want cold emails** (regardless of how good yours is)
- **It's not a reflection of your email quality**

**What's important:**
- ✅ **Interested replies** (people saying YES)
- ❌ Not unsubscribes (people saying NO)

**Focus on the yes's, not the no's.**

---

## ✅ HOW TO HANDLE UNSUBSCRIBE IN INSTANTLY

### **Step 1: Remove Them Immediately**

1. **Open the reply** in Instantly
2. **Click "Mark as Unsubscribed"** or similar
3. **Remove from campaign** immediately

**Why:** 
- Keeps your list clean
- Shows professionalism
- Prevents sending more (legal/compliance)

---

### **Step 2: Reply Professionally (Optional but Recommended)**

**Quick professional response:**

```
Subject: Re: Remove from mailing list

Hi [Name],

Done! I've removed [Company] from my mailing list.

Apologies for the interruption.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Why:**
- Shows you respect their request
- Maintains professional reputation
- Takes 10 seconds

---

### **Step 3: Don't Take It Personally**

**Remember:**
- They're not rejecting YOU
- They're rejecting unsolicited emails (in general)
- Some people just have strict inbox policies
- It's a numbers game - focus on the 97% who didn't unsubscribe

---

## 📊 MONITOR YOUR UNSUBSCRIBE RATE

### **Track This Metric:**

**Unsubscribe Rate = Unsubscribes / Total Sent**

**Benchmarks:**
- **< 5%** = Excellent (low unsubscribe rate)
- **5-10%** = Normal (acceptable)
- **10-15%** = High (check your targeting/messaging)
- **> 15%** = Too high (something wrong)

**Your current:** Need to track after more emails sent

---

## 🔍 WHY PEOPLE UNSUBSCRIBE (And How to Reduce)

### **Reason 1: Wrong Target (Most Common)**

**They're not the decision maker:**
- You emailed receptionist, not owner
- They don't handle bookings/leads
- They forward to boss, but unsubscribe themselves

**Fix:**
- ✅ Better targeting (owners, managers only)
- ✅ Use LinkedIn to find decision makers
- ✅ Verify emails are owner emails (not generic info@)

---

### **Reason 2: Too Salesy / Generic**

**Email feels like spam:**
- Generic template (no personalization)
- All about you, not them
- No clear value for their specific situation

**Fix:**
- ✅ Personalize first line (mention their salon/city)
- ✅ Focus on their problem, not your solution
- ✅ Use specific numbers/references

---

### **Reason 3: Not Relevant**

**They don't need your service:**
- They already have lead follow-up handled
- They're not spending on ads (no leads to follow up)
- Different business model

**Fix:**
- ✅ Pre-qualify better (find salons actively running ads)
- ✅ Check their website (do they have booking forms?)
- ✅ LinkedIn research (see if they're growing/expanding)

---

### **Reason 4: Timing**

**Wrong time to reach out:**
- Just launched (too early)
- Seasonal business (slow season)
- Recently got burned by another vendor

**Fix:**
- ✅ Can't always control this
- ✅ But you can note timing preferences for future

---

## 💡 WAYS TO REDUCE UNSUBSCRIBES

### **1. Better Targeting**

**Before sending, verify:**
- ✅ They're salon owners/managers (decision makers)
- ✅ They run Google Ads or have booking forms (need your service)
- ✅ Email is owner email (not generic info@salon.com)

**Better targeting = Fewer unsubscribes**

---

### **2. Softer First Email**

**Current approach might be too direct. Try:**

**Option A: Question Opener (Softer)**
```
Subject: Quick question about [Salon Name]

Hi [Name],

Quick question: Do you handle lead follow-up yourself at [Salon Name], or do you have staff manage it?

Just curious - most salons struggle to call leads back fast enough.

[Your Name]
```

**Why:** Feels like research, not sales. Lower unsubscribe rate.

---

**Option B: Soft Value (Less Aggressive)**
```
Subject: Idea for [Salon Name]

Hi [Name],

Noticed [Salon Name] has great reviews - well done!

Quick thought: Most salons I speak with get 20-30 leads/month but only follow up with half because they're busy with clients.

I've helped a few salons double their booking rate by automating follow-up calls. Worth a quick chat?

[Your Name]
```

**Why:** Acknowledges them first, softer approach.

---

### **3. Add Opt-Out in First Email**

**Add to signature:**
```
[Your Name]
[Phone]

P.S. - If this isn't relevant, just reply "REMOVE" and I'll take you off the list.
```

**Why:**
- Shows respect for their inbox
- Reduces annoyance
- Makes it easy to unsubscribe (they don't need to ask)

---

### **4. Test Subject Lines**

**Current subject:** Might be too aggressive

**Test softer versions:**
- ❌ "Quick math problem" (might feel gimmicky)
- ✅ "Quick question about [Salon Name]" (softer)
- ✅ "Idea for [Salon Name]" (curiosity)
- ✅ "[Name] - 2-min question" (personal)

**Track:** Which subjects get fewer unsubscribes?

---

## 📈 YOUR CURRENT METRICS

**What we know:**
- ✅ **28% open rate** = Good (deliverability working)
- ✅ **2.9% reply rate** = Good (hitting target)
- ❓ **Unsubscribe rate** = Need to track (probably normal 5-10%)

**Focus on:**
1. **Scaling volume** (get to 1,000+ emails sent)
2. **Keeping reply rate at 2-3%+**
3. **Tracking unsubscribe rate** (should stay under 10%)

---

## 🎯 ACTION PLAN

### **Right Now:**

1. **Remove the unsubscriber** from Instantly
2. **Reply professionally** (optional 10-second email)
3. **Don't worry about it** - this is normal

### **This Week:**

1. **Track unsubscribe rate** (after 200+ emails sent)
2. **If > 10%:** Review targeting + messaging
3. **If < 5%:** You're good, keep going!

### **Ongoing:**

1. **Focus on interested replies** (the yes's)
2. **Ignore the noise** (unsubscribes, non-replies)
3. **Keep scaling volume** (more volume = more replies)
