## üìù STEP 4: CREATE YOUR EMAIL TEMPLATES

### Email 1: Introduction
**Subject:** Quick question about [Practice Name]'s lead follow-up

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Practice Name] has a strong online presence. Quick question - are you currently following up with all your Google Ads leads within 5 minutes?

Most dental practices lose 50-70% of their leads because staff are too busy treating patients to call back quickly.

I help practices like yours convert 40% more leads into booked appointments using AI-powered follow-up.

Worth a quick 15-minute call to see if this could work for [Practice Name]?

Book a time here: [Your Booking Link]

Best,
Jonah Hughes

```

### Email 2: Social Proof (Day 3 - IF OPENED Email 1)
**Subject:** How a local practice booked 12 extra appointments last month

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Following up on my message about lead conversion.

I just helped a dental practice similar to [Practice Name] book 12 extra appointments last month by following up with their existing leads within 5 minutes.

They were losing 60% of their Google Ads leads before we started working together.

Here's what we did:
‚Ä¢ AI calls every lead within 5 minutes of inquiry
‚Ä¢ Persistent follow-up (most leads need 3-5 touches)
‚Ä¢ Appointments booked directly into their calendar
‚Ä¢ They just show up to treat patients

The practice owner told me: "I didn't realize how many leads were slipping through the cracks until we started tracking it."

Would you be interested in a quick case study showing the exact results?

Best,
Jonah
```

### Email 2B: Different Angle (Day 3 - IF NOT OPENED Email 1)
**Subject:** Are you losing leads to competitors?

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Quick question: When someone fills out a contact form on your website at 7pm, do they get a response within 5 minutes?

If not, they're probably booking with a competitor.

Studies show:
‚Ä¢ 78% of customers buy from the first responder
‚Ä¢ 50% of leads go to whoever responds first
‚Ä¢ Most practices lose 60-70% of leads due to slow follow-up

I help dental practices like [Practice Name] convert more leads by responding immediately (even outside business hours).

Worth a quick 15-minute call?

Book here: [Your Booking Link]

Best,
Jonah Hughes
JTLH Media
```

### Email 3: Free Trial Offer (Day 7)
**Subject:** Free trial week - no risk

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

I understand you're busy running [Practice Name].

That's exactly why most practices lose 50-70% of their leads - no time to follow up quickly.

Here's my offer:

**FREE TRIAL WEEK**
‚Ä¢ I handle all your lead follow-up for 7 days
‚Ä¢ You just show up to the appointments
‚Ä¢ No risk, no commitment
‚Ä¢ See real results before you pay anything

If we don't book at least 2-3 extra appointments, you owe me nothing.

Worth a 15-minute call to discuss?

Book here: [Your Booking Link]

Best,
Jonah
```

### Email 4: Pricing-Focused (Day 7 - IF CLICKED LINK in previous emails)
**Subject:** [First Name], here's the investment breakdown

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

I noticed you're interested in improving your lead conversion.

Here's the simple breakdown:

**Monthly Investment:** ¬£497/month
**What You Get:**
‚Ä¢ AI follows up with every lead within 5 minutes
‚Ä¢ 24/7 coverage (evenings, weekends, holidays)
‚Ä¢ Direct booking into your calendar
‚Ä¢ Typically 8-12 extra appointments per month

**ROI Calculation:**
‚Ä¢ If you close just 3 extra patients per month
‚Ä¢ Average treatment value: ¬£500
‚Ä¢ Monthly revenue increase: ¬£1,500
‚Ä¢ Your profit: ¬£1,000+ per month

### Email 5: Urgency (Day 14)
**Subject:** Last chance - free trial ending soon

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

This is my final email about the lead conversion service.

I'm limiting free trials to 5 practices this month, and I have 2 spots left.

If you're interested in booking 8-12 extra appointments per month without any extra work, reply with "INTERESTED" and I'll send you a case study.

Otherwise, I'll stop following up and assume it's not a priority right now.

Best,
Jonah
```

### Email 6: Break-up (Day 21)
**Subject:** Thanks for your time

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Thanks for your time. I'll stop following up about the lead conversion service.

If you ever want to stop losing 50% of your leads, just reply to this email.

Best of luck with [Practice Name]!

Jonah Hughes
JTLH Media

P.S. If you know any other practice owners who might benefit from this, I'd appreciate an intro.
