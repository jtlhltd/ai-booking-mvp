# üß™ VAPI ASSISTANT TESTING PLAN

## üéØ GOAL
Find the optimal Vapi assistant configuration that maximizes booking rate while maintaining positive sentiment and natural conversation flow.

---

## üìä PHASE 1: BASELINE TESTING (Week 1)

### **Objective:** Establish current performance metrics

### **What to Test:**
1. **Current Script Performance**
   - Make 20 test calls with your existing Vapi assistant
   - Track: Booking rate, sentiment, objections, avg call duration
   - **Baseline Target:** 30% booking rate minimum

### **Metrics to Track:**
```
‚úÖ Booking Rate (goal: 35-40%)
‚úÖ Sentiment (goal: 60%+ positive)
‚úÖ Average Call Duration (goal: 2-4 minutes)
‚úÖ Objection Types (most common ones)
‚úÖ Drop-off Rate (% who hang up early)
‚úÖ Voicemail Hit Rate (% reaching voicemail)
```

### **Test Leads:**
Use these **FREE test numbers** (Google Voice, test SIMs, friends/family):
- 10 "interested" personas (answer, engaged)
- 5 "skeptical" personas (objections, price concerns)
- 5 "busy" personas (short answers, wants to reschedule)

### **Documentation:**
```markdown
Call #1
- Lead: Test #1 (interested)
- Script: V1-baseline
- Outcome: Booked ‚úÖ
- Duration: 3:45
- Sentiment: Positive
- Notes: Asked about pricing but converted easily
- Recording URL: [link]
```

## üî¨ PHASE 2: VOICE & TONE TESTING (Week 1-2)

### **Hypothesis:** Voice personality affects booking rate

### **Variables to Test:**

#### **Test 1: Voice Selection**
```javascript
const voices = [
  { id: "jennifer", style: "Professional, warm" },
  { id: "mark", style: "Energetic, confident" },
  { id: "sarah", style: "Calm, trustworthy" }
];
```

**Method:**
- 15 calls per voice (45 calls total)
- Same script for all
- Compare booking rates

**Expected Result:** One voice will outperform by 10-20%

---

#### **Test 2: Speaking Speed**
```javascript
const speeds = [0.9, 1.0, 1.1]; // Slow, normal, fast
```

**Hypothesis:** Slightly faster = more confident/professional

**Method:**
- 10 calls per speed (30 calls total)
- Track: Engagement, interruptions, booking rate

---

#### **Test 3: Temperature (AI Creativity)**
```javascript
const temperatures = [0.5, 0.7, 0.9];
// 0.5 = More predictable, script-like
// 0.7 = Balanced (recommended)
// 0.9 = More creative, natural variations
```

**Method:**
- 10 calls per temperature (30 calls total)
- Track: Consistency, natural flow, booking rate

---

## üí¨ PHASE 3: SCRIPT OPTIMIZATION (Week 2-3)

### **What to Test:**

#### **Test 4: Opening Lines**

**Current (Baseline):**
> "Hi [Name], this is [Your Business]. You recently inquired about [Service]. Do you have 2 minutes to chat?"

**Variation A (Direct):**
> "Hi [Name], calling about your [Service] inquiry. We can get you booked this week - when works best?"

**Variation B (Curiosity):**
> "Hi [Name], great news about your [Service] request. Got a quick question - still interested?"

**Variation C (Urgency):**
> "Hi [Name], following up on your [Service] inquiry. We have a spot opening up Friday - want to grab it?"

**Method:**
- 10 calls per variation (40 calls total)
- Track: Immediate engagement, booking rate, hang-up rate

---

#### **Test 5: Objection Handling**

**Objection: "How much does it cost?"**

**Response A (Direct):**
> "Great question! It's ¬£[X]. And here's what makes it worth it: [value prop]. Want to book a time?"

**Response B (Reframe):**
> "Most clients see 3-10x ROI in month one. The investment is ¬£[X]. When would you like to start?"

**Response C (Trial Close):**
> "Let's get you booked first so you can see if it's right for you. No pressure. What's your schedule like this week?"

**Method:**
- Plant price objection in test calls
- Rotate responses
- Track: Conversion after objection

---

#### **Test 6: Call-to-Action Strength**

**Weak CTA:**
> "Would you maybe be interested in booking a time?"

**Medium CTA:**
> "Would you like to book a time this week?"

**Strong CTA:**
> "I can book you for Tuesday at 2pm or Thursday at 4pm - which works better?"

**Assumptive CTA:**
> "Perfect! Let me get you locked in. Are mornings or afternoons better for you?"

**Method:**
- 10 calls per CTA style
- Track: Booking rate, hesitation

---

## üîÑ PHASE 4: FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCES (Week 3-4)

### **Test 7: Voicemail Scripts**

**Variation A (Brief):**
> "Hi [Name], this is [Business] about your [Service] inquiry. Call me back at [Number]. Thanks!"

**Variation B (Urgency):**
> "Hi [Name], we have your [Service] request. We're booking appointments this week - call [Number] to secure your spot."

**Variation C (Value):**
> "Hi [Name], calling about [Service]. Most clients see [result]. Let's get you booked - [Number]."

**Method:**
- Leave each voicemail type 10 times
- Track: Callback rate within 24 hours

---

### **Test 8: Multi-Touch Cadence**

**Sequence A (Aggressive):**
```
Touch 1: Call (0 min)
Touch 2: SMS (30 min)
Touch 3: Call (4 hours)

---

## üì± PHASE 5: TIMING OPTIMIZATION (Week 4)

### **Test 9: Call Time Analysis**

**Method:**
```
Test Group 1: Call 9am-11am (morning)
Test Group 2: Call 12pm-2pm (lunch)
Test Group 3: Call 3pm-5pm (afternoon)
Test Group 4: Call 6pm-8pm (evening)
```

**Track:**
- Answer rate
- Booking rate
- Call duration

**Expected:** Lunch (12-2pm) may have lower answer rate but higher booking rate (people have time)

---

### **Test 10: Response Speed**

**Hypothesis:** Calling within 30 seconds vs 5 minutes makes a difference

**Method:**
```
Group A: Call within 30 seconds of lead submission
Group B: Call within 5 minutes
Group C: Call within 1 hour
Group D: Call within 24 hours
```

**Track:** Booking rate per group

**Expected:** 30-second response outperforms by 40-60%

- After: 42% booking rate on 100 leads = 42 appointments
- Extra appointments: +12 per 100 leads
- At ¬£150 average value: +¬£1,800 per 100 leads
- Testing paid for itself 60x over
```

## üéØ DECISION FRAMEWORK

After each test, ask:

1. **Did this improve booking rate?** (primary metric)
2. **Did sentiment stay positive?** (can't sacrifice this)
3. **Was it scalable?** (works for 1,000 calls, not just 10)
4. **Does it feel natural?** (not robotic or pushy)

**If YES to all 4** ‚Üí Keep it ‚úÖ  
**If NO to any** ‚Üí Discard ‚ùå

### **Monthly Reviews:**
- First Monday of each month: Review all test data

## üìû NEED HELP?

### **Stuck on Testing?**
1. Start with just ONE test (opening line)
2. Make 10 calls
3. Pick the winner
4. Move to next test

### **Not Seeing Improvements?**
- Check: Are you testing the right variable?
- Check: Is sample size large enough? (10+ calls per variant)
- Check: Are test leads representative of real leads?
