# üéØ WHAT TO TEST & HOW TO DECIDE

## The Problem: "I can test in Vapi browser... but what should I actually change?"

---

## üß† THE DECISION FRAMEWORK

### **Use This 3-Step Process:**

```
1. LISTEN to your current script (browser test)
   ‚Üì
2. ASK: "What made me cringe/hesitate/want to hang up?"
   ‚Üì
3. FIX that specific thing
   ‚Üì
4. TEST again
   ‚Üì
5. REPEAT until you'd book from that call
```

---

## üéß STEP 1: LISTEN TO YOUR SCRIPT (10 minutes)

### **Browser Test Your Current Script 3 Times:**

**Test #1: Play "Interested Lead"**
- Answer enthusiastically
- Ask normal questions
- See how it flows

**Test #2: Play "Skeptical Lead"**  
- Challenge everything
- Say "I'm not sure..."
- Push back on price
- See how AI handles objections

**Test #3: Play "Busy Lead"**
- Give short answers ("Yep", "Uh-huh")
- Sound distracted
- Say "Can you call back?"
- See if AI respects your time

---

## üìù STEP 2: TAKE NOTES (5 minutes)

**While listening, write down EVERY moment where you think:**

‚ùå **"That's awkward"**  
‚ùå **"I'd hang up here"**  
‚ùå **"That doesn't make sense"**  
‚ùå **"Too pushy"**  
‚ùå **"Too robotic"**  
‚ùå **"I don't believe that"**  
‚ùå **"Why would I care?"**

**Example Notes:**

```
0:15 - Opening line feels too formal, would make me defensive
0:45 - AI ignored my question about pricing
1:20 - "Let me just..." phrase sounds robotic
1:45 - Price reveal was too abrupt, no setup
2:10 - Didn't ask about my availability, just assumed
```

---

## üîç STEP 3: CATEGORIZE THE ISSUES

Put each "cringe moment" into a category:

### **Category 1: OPENING LINE** (First 30 seconds)
**Symptoms:**
- You felt defensive immediately
- Thought "ugh, another sales call"
- Wanted to hang up right away
- Didn't grab your attention

**Fix:** Change opening line

---

### **Category 2: OBJECTION HANDLING** (When you push back)
**Symptoms:**
- AI ignored your objection
- Response felt dismissive
- Made you MORE skeptical, not less
- Didn't actually answer your concern

**Fix:** Rewrite objection responses

---

### **Category 3: TONE/VOICE** (Overall vibe)
**Symptoms:**
- Too aggressive/pushy
- Too timid/weak
- Robotic/scripted
- Wrong voice (too young/old/formal/casual)

**Fix:** Change voice, speed, or temperature

---

### **Category 4: PACING** (Flow of conversation)
**Symptoms:**
- AI talked too much (monologue)
- AI talked too fast (rushed)
- Didn't pause for your responses
- Interrupted you

**Fix:** Add pauses, shorten sentences

---

### **Category 5: CLOSE** (Asking for the appointment)
**Symptoms:**
- Asked "Would you like to book?" (weak)
- Didn't ask at all (missed opportunity)
- Too assumptive (made you defensive)
- Unclear next steps

**Fix:** Rewrite call-to-action

---

## üéØ THE FIX LIBRARY

### **Fix 1: Opening Line Issues**

#### **If it feels too formal:**

‚ùå **BAD:**
```
"Good morning, am I speaking with [Name]? 
This is [Business] calling regarding your inquiry 
about our services. Do you have a moment to speak?"
```

‚úÖ **BETTER:**
```
"Hi [Name], this is [Business]. You asked about [Service] - 
got 2 minutes to chat?"
```

---

#### **If it's boring/no hook:**

‚ùå **BAD:**
```
"Hi, I'm calling about your inquiry."
```

‚úÖ **BETTER:**
```
"Hi [Name], great news about your [Service] request - 
quick question, still interested?"
```

---

#### **If it's too salesy:**

‚ùå **BAD:**
```
"I have an AMAZING opportunity for you today!"
```

‚úÖ **BETTER:**
```
"Hi [Name], following up on your request. 
Want to see if this is right for you?"
```

---

### **Fix 2: Objection Handling Issues**

#### **If AI ignores objections:**

‚ùå **BAD:**
```
Lead: "How much does it cost?"
AI: "Let me tell you about our features..."
```

‚úÖ **BETTER:**
```
Lead: "How much does it cost?"
AI: "Great question. It's ¬£799. Most clients see 3-10x ROI 
in month one. Want to discuss how that works?"
```

---

#### **If response is too defensive:**

‚ùå **BAD:**
```
Lead: "That's expensive"
AI: "Actually, it's quite reasonable compared to competitors..."
```

‚úÖ **BETTER:**
```
Lead: "That's expensive"
AI: "I get it. Here's why clients say it pays for itself: 
[brief value prop]. Want to see the math?"
```

---

#### **If response lacks empathy:**

‚ùå **BAD:**
```
Lead: "I need to think about it"
AI: "Well, I need an answer now. Can you decide?"
```

‚úÖ **BETTER:**
```
Lead: "I need to think about it"
AI: "Totally understand. What specific questions can I answer 
to help you decide?"
```

---

### **Fix 3: Tone/Voice Issues**

#### **If it sounds robotic:**

**Try:**
- Increase temperature: 0.7 ‚Üí 0.8
- Add contractions: "I am" ‚Üí "I'm", "You are" ‚Üí "You're"
- Add filler words: "So...", "Well...", "Look..."
- Use shorter sentences

‚ùå **ROBOTIC:**
```
"I would be delighted to assist you with scheduling 
an appointment at your earliest convenience."
```

‚úÖ **NATURAL:**
```
"Let's get you booked. What's your schedule like this week?"
```

---

#### **If it's too pushy:**

**Try:**
- Add softeners: "Maybe...", "If you want...", "No pressure..."
- Ask permission: "Is it okay if I...", "Would you like me to..."
- Offer options: "We could do X or Y - which sounds better?"

‚ùå **PUSHY:**
```
"You need to book today. This deal expires tonight."
```

‚úÖ **BETTER:**
```
"No pressure, but we're booking up this week. 
Want to at least hold a spot?"
```

---

#### **If voice is wrong:**

**Try different Vapi voices:**
- Professional service? ‚Üí "Jennifer" (warm, trustworthy)
- Energy/excitement? ‚Üí "Mark" (confident, dynamic)
- High-trust industry? ‚Üí "Sarah" (calm, reassuring)

**Test speeds:**
- 0.9x = More thoughtful/deliberate
- 1.0x = Normal
- 1.1x = More confident/professional

---

### **Fix 4: Pacing Issues**

#### **If AI talks too much:**

‚ùå **BAD:**
```
"So let me tell you about our company, we were founded 
in 2020 and we specialize in helping businesses like yours 
achieve their goals through our innovative approach that 
combines AI technology with human expertise to deliver..."
```

‚úÖ **BETTER:**
```
"We help businesses like yours book more appointments. 
Most clients see 40% more bookings. Interested?"
```

**Rule:** No sentence longer than 15 words.

---

#### **If AI doesn't pause:**

**Add explicit pauses in script:**

```
"Hi [Name], calling about your [Service] inquiry."
[PAUSE 2 seconds]
"Quick question - still interested?"
[WAIT for response]
```

---

### **Fix 5: Close Issues**

#### **If close is too weak:**

‚ùå **WEAK:**
```
"So... would you maybe want to book something?"
```

‚úÖ **STRONGER:**
```
"Great! Let me get you booked. Are mornings or afternoons 
better for you?"
```

---

#### **If close is too assumptive:**

‚ùå **TOO ASSUMPTIVE:**
```
"Perfect, I'm booking you for Tuesday at 2pm."
```

‚úÖ **BETTER:**
```
"Awesome! I have Tuesday at 2pm or Thursday at 4pm - 
which works better?"
```

---

#### **If there's no close at all:**

**Add a clear CTA at the end:**

```
"So that's how it works. Next step is booking a quick call 
to see if it's right for you. What's your availability this week?"
```

---

## üîÑ THE TESTING LOOP

### **How to Actually Use This:**

```
1. Browser test current script
   ‚Üì
2. Note 1-3 "cringe moments"
   ‚Üì
3. Pick the WORST one
   ‚Üì
4. Find the fix in this guide
   ‚Üì
5. Update Vapi script
   ‚Üì
6. Browser test again
   ‚Üì
7. Is it better? 
   ‚Üí YES: Move to next issue
   ‚Üí NO: Try different fix
   ‚Üì
8. Repeat until you'd book from that call
```

---

## üéØ PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK

### **If you have multiple issues, fix in this order:**

**1. Opening Line** (MOST IMPORTANT)
- If they hang up in first 30 seconds, nothing else matters
- Fix this FIRST

**2. Major Objections** (SECOND)
- If AI can't handle "How much?" or "I need to think", you lose 60% of leads
- Fix this NEXT

**3. Close** (THIRD)
- If AI doesn't ask for the booking, you lose 20% of interested leads
- Fix this THIRD

**4. Tone/Voice** (FOURTH)
- If it sounds robotic but handles objections well, you'll still convert
- Polish this LATER

**5. Pacing** (FIFTH)
- Nice to have, but won't make/break conversions
- Optimize this LAST

---

## üìä THE "WOULD I BOOK?" TEST

After each change, ask yourself:

### **The 5 Questions:**

1. **"Would I answer this call?"** (Opening)
   - YES ‚Üí Opening is good ‚úÖ
   - NO ‚Üí Fix opening first

2. **"Would I stay on the line?"** (Hook)
   - YES ‚Üí Hook works ‚úÖ
   - NO ‚Üí Add more value/curiosity

3. **"Would I trust this?"** (Credibility)
   - YES ‚Üí Tone is good ‚úÖ
   - NO ‚Üí Add social proof, soften tone

4. **"Would I overcome my objections?"** (Handling)
   - YES ‚Üí Objection responses work ‚úÖ
   - NO ‚Üí Rewrite responses

5. **"Would I say yes to booking?"** (Close)
   - YES ‚Üí Script is ready ‚úÖ
   - NO ‚Üí Stronger CTA needed

**If all 5 are YES ‚Üí Deploy the script! üöÄ**

## üí° PRO TIPS

### **Tip 1: Record Your Browser Tests**
Use Windows Game Bar (Win + G) to record your screen.  
Watch back later - you'll catch things you missed live.

---

### **Tip 2: Test When Tired**
If the script works when you're tired/distracted,  
it'll work on real leads (who are also tired/distracted).

---

### **Tip 3: The "Friend Test"**
Put browser test on speaker.  
Have a friend listen.  
Ask: "Would you book from that call?"  
Friends are more honest than you are.

---

### **Tip 4: Test Different Times**
- Morning test (fresh brain)
- Afternoon test (normal state)
- Evening test (tired/skeptical)

If it works in all 3 ‚Üí it's a winner.

---

### **Tip 5: One Change at a Time**
Don't change 5 things at once.  
You won't know what worked.

Change ONE thing ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Evaluate ‚Üí Repeat
