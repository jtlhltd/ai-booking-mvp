## üìß STEP 5: CREATE YOUR EMAIL TEMPLATES

### EMAIL 1: Introduction
**Subject:** Quick question about *|BUSINESS_NAME|*'s lead follow-up

**Body:**
```
Hi *|FNAME|*,

I noticed *|BUSINESS_NAME|* has a strong online presence. Quick question - are you currently following up with all your leads within 5 minutes?

Most businesses lose 50-70% of their leads because staff are too busy to call back quickly.

I help businesses like yours convert more leads into booked appointments using AI-powered follow-up - so you never miss an opportunity.

Worth a quick 15-minute call to see if this could work for *|BUSINESS_NAME|*?

### EMAIL 2: Social Proof
**Subject:** How most businesses are losing 60% of their leads

**Body:**
```
Hi *|FNAME|*,

Following up on my message about lead conversion.

I've been researching this problem extensively, and the numbers are shocking:

Most businesses lose 50-70% of their leads because they don't follow up quickly enough.

Here's what typically happens:
‚Ä¢ Lead comes in at 6pm - no response until next day
‚Ä¢ Lead fills form on weekend - waits until Monday
‚Ä¢ Staff are busy with existing customers - leads get forgotten
‚Ä¢ By the time you call, they've already booked with a competitor

Studies show:
‚Ä¢ 78% of customers buy from the first responder
‚Ä¢ 50% of leads go to whoever responds first

I'm building a service that helps businesses like *|BUSINESS_NAME|* respond to every lead within 5 minutes using AI-powered follow-up.

Would you be interested in a quick 15-minute call to see how this could work for your business?

### EMAIL 4: Value Focused
**Subject:** *|FNAME|*, here's how it works

**Body:**
```
Hi *|FNAME|*,

I noticed you're interested in improving your lead conversion.

Here's how the service works:

What You Get:
‚Ä¢ AI follows up with every lead within 5 minutes
‚Ä¢ 24/7 coverage (evenings, weekends, holidays)
‚Ä¢ Direct booking into your calendar
‚Ä¢ Typically 8-12 extra appointments per month

### EMAIL 5: Urgency
**Subject:** Last chance - free trial ending soon

**Body:**
```
Hi *|FNAME|*,

This is my final email about the lead conversion service.

I'm limiting free trials to 5 businesses this month, and I have 2 spots left.

If you're interested in booking 8-12 extra appointments per month without any extra work, reply with "INTERESTED" and I'll send you a case study.

Otherwise, I'll stop following up and assume it's not a priority right now.

Best,
Jonah Hughes

jonah@jtlhmedia.com
```

### EMAIL 6: Break-up
**Subject:** Thanks for your time

**Body:**
```
Hi *|FNAME|*,

Thanks for your time. I'll stop following up about the lead conversion service.

If you ever want to stop losing leads, just reply to this email.

Best of luck with *|BUSINESS_NAME|*!

P.S. If you know any other business owners who might benefit from this, I'd appreciate an intro.
