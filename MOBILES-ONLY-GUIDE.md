## 🎯 **Best Practices**

1. **Search Smaller Cities First**
   - Big cities = more landlines only
   - Smaller cities = more mobile-friendly businesses

2. **Target Newer Businesses**
   - Newer businesses list mobiles more often
   - Filter by "opened in last 5 years" if possible

3. **Try Different Industries**
   - Real estate agents → High mobile usage
   - Home services → High mobile usage
   - Law firms → Lower mobile usage (more landlines)

4. **Use Decision Maker Finder**
   - If business only has landline
   - Use decision maker tool to find owner's mobile

**Search Queries With Fewer Mobiles:**

---

## 📈 **Conversion Rates**

**Mobile Numbers:**
- ✅ 40-50% answer rate
- ✅ 80% reach decision maker
- ✅ 10-15% interested

**Landlines:**
- ❌ 20-30% answer rate
- ❌ 30% reach decision maker (rest are receptionists)
- ❌ 5-8% interested

**Verdict:** Mobiles are **2-3x better** for cold calling!

## 🚀 **Quick Test**

---

## ❓ **FAQ**

**Q: What if I only get 2-3 results?**
A: That's normal for mobiles-only. Quality > quantity. Those 2-3 are much better leads than 50 landlines.

**Q: Can I turn off mobile filtering?**
A: Yes! Uncheck the checkbox in the web dashboard. Or modify the API call to set `mobilesOnly: false`.

**Q: How do you detect mobile vs landline?**
A: UK mobile numbers start with 07. Landlines start with 01/02/03. We check the first 2 digits.

**Q: What about VoIP numbers?**
A: VoIP numbers (like 056x) are excluded by default. They have poor answer rates for cold calls.
