# 🚀 SCALE EMAIL VOLUME - TWO OPTIONS

**Current Situation:**
- ✅ 4 email accounts connected
- ✅ Sending ~120-160 emails/day (30-40 per account)
- ❌ Need more capacity for new leads

**Two Ways to Scale:**
1. **Add More Email Accounts** (Quick + Scalable)
2. **Increase Daily Limits** (Fast but Limited)

---

## 📊 CURRENT CAPACITY ANALYSIS

**Current Setup:**
- 4 accounts × 35 emails/day = **140 emails/day**
- Monthly capacity: ~4,200 emails
- **At 3% reply rate:** ~126 replies/month

**If you have 500+ leads/month:**
- You need **~500-1,000 emails/month** minimum
- Current: 140/day × 30 days = 4,200/month ✅ (enough)
- But if leads are piling up, you need **more daily capacity**

---

## 🎯 OPTION 1: INCREASE DAILY LIMITS (5 minutes)

**Best For:** Quick boost without adding accounts

**How to Do It:**

### Step 1: Check Current Limits (2 mins)
1. Go to **Instantly.ai** → **Settings** → **Email Accounts**
2. Note each account's current daily limit
3. Check if accounts are being fully utilized

### Step 2: Increase Limits Safely (3 mins)
1. Click on each email account
2. Edit **Daily Sending Limit**
3. **Recommended increases:**
   - **Current:** 30-35/day
   - **Increase to:** 40-50/day (safe for Gmail)
   - **Maximum safe:** 50-60/day (if account is warmed up)

4. Save changes

**New Capacity:**
- 4 accounts × 50/day = **200 emails/day**
- Monthly: ~6,000 emails/month
- **+40% more volume!**

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Account Warm-Up Rules

**If accounts are NEW (< 30 days old):**
- Max: 30-40/day (don't go higher)
- Risk: Account suspension if too aggressive

**If accounts are WARMED (> 30 days old):**
- Can safely do: 40-50/day
- Well-established: 50-60/day

**Signs account is warmed up:**
- ✅ Low bounce rate (< 2%)
- ✅ Good open rates (> 20%)
- ✅ No spam complaints
- ✅ Account age > 30 days

### Gmail Limits (Reference):
- **Free Gmail:** 500/day max (but don't go above 50-60 for cold email)
- **Google Workspace:** 2,000/day max (can do 100-150/day for cold email)
- **Best practice:** Stay under 50/day per account to avoid spam filters

---

## 🎯 OPTION 2: ADD MORE EMAIL ACCOUNTS (30 minutes)

**Best For:** Sustainable scaling, better deliverability

**Why This Works:**
- Distributes load across more accounts
- Better deliverability (less spam risk)
- Can send more total volume safely
- Each account can stay at 30-40/day (safer)

### Step 1: Create New Email Accounts (15 mins)

**Option A: Gmail Accounts (Free)**
1. Go to **gmail.com**
2. Create new account (use different name/variation)
3. Example: `jonah.outreach@gmail.com`, `jonah.leads@gmail.com`
4. Verify email address
5. **Note:** Gmail free accounts are limited to 500/day but for cold email, stay at 30-50/day

**Option B: Google Workspace (Recommended for Scale)**
1. Sign up for **Google Workspace** ($6/month per account)
2. Get professional domain (e.g., `jonah@jtlhmedia.com`)
3. Create multiple aliases: `outreach@jtlhmedia.com`, `leads@jtlhmedia.com`
4. Each can send 100-150/day safely
5. **Better deliverability** than free Gmail

**Option C: Multiple Free Gmail Accounts**
- Create 2-4 more Gmail accounts
- Use different names: `jonah.hughes.outreach@gmail.com`
- Each can send 30-40/day
- **Total cost:** FREE

### Step 2: Connect to Instantly.ai (10 mins)

For each new account:
1. Go to **Instantly.ai** → **Settings** → **Email Accounts**
2. Click **"Add Account"**
3. Select **Gmail** (or your provider)
4. Authorize Instantly to access the account
5. Wait for verification (1-2 minutes)
6. **Set daily limit:** 30-40/day (to start)
7. ✅ Account connected!

**Repeat for all new accounts**

### Step 3: Distribute Leads Across Accounts (5 mins)

1. Go to your campaign → **Leads** tab
2. Check lead distribution
3. Instantly should auto-distribute, but verify:
   - Leads are evenly spread across all accounts
   - Each account has similar number of leads
   - No account is overloaded

**New Capacity Examples:**

**Scenario A: Add 2 More Gmail Accounts**
- 6 accounts × 35/day = **210 emails/day**
- Monthly: ~6,300 emails/month
- **+50% more volume!**

**Scenario B: Add 4 More Gmail Accounts**
- 8 accounts × 35/day = **280 emails/day**
- Monthly: ~8,400 emails/month
- **+100% more volume!**

**Scenario C: Add 2 Google Workspace Accounts**
- 6 accounts × 50/day = **300 emails/day**
- Monthly: ~9,000 emails/month
- **+114% more volume!**

---

## 🎯 OPTION 3: COMBINE BOTH (RECOMMENDED)

**Best Strategy:** Increase limits + Add accounts

**Example:**
- Current: 4 accounts × 35/day = 140/day
- **Action 1:** Increase to 40/day = 160/day
- **Action 2:** Add 2 more accounts × 40/day = 80/day
- **New Total:** 6 accounts × 40/day = **240 emails/day**
- **Monthly:** ~7,200 emails/month
- **+71% more volume!**
