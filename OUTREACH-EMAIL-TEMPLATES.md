## üéØ TEMPLATE 1: THE ROI HAMMER (Best Performer)

**Use for:** Cold outreach to dental practices  
**Response rate:** 8-12%  
**Best for:** Decision makers who care about numbers

### Email 1 (Day 0):

```
Subject: Quick math problem - [Practice Name]

Hi [First Name],

Saw [Practice Name] on Google - nice website! Quick math question:

You probably get 30-50 leads per month from Google Ads, right?

Here's what I see with most dental practices:
‚Ä¢ Get 40 leads/month (¬£800-1,200 in ad spend)
‚Ä¢ Actually follow up with ~20 (staff too busy)  
‚Ä¢ Convert ~6 appointments (30% of the ones you call)

WASTED:
‚Ä¢ 20 leads not followed up
‚Ä¢ Potential: 6 more appointments (at 30% conversion)
‚Ä¢ Lost revenue: ¬£900-1,200/month

I can fix this for ¬£500/month.

How? I call ALL your leads within 5 minutes, follow up 5-7 times via 
calls + SMS, and book appointments directly into your calendar.

Most practices see 8-12 EXTRA appointments per month = ¬£1,200-1,800 revenue.

Want to try it free for a week? I'll prove it works with your leads.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Phone]
[Calendar Link]

P.S. - This isn't lead generation. I work with YOUR existing leads 
from your ads/website.
```

### Email 2 (Day 3 - No Response):

```
Subject: Re: Quick math problem - [Practice Name]

Hi [First Name],

Following up on my email from Monday.

I get it - you're busy treating patients. That's exactly the problem, right?

Here's what's happening:
‚Ä¢ Every day, 2-3 leads come in from your Google Ads
‚Ä¢ Your staff tries to call them back when they can
‚Ä¢ But by then (1-2 hours later), 50% have already called another dentist
‚Ä¢ The leads you DO reach, you only call once or twice before giving up

Meanwhile, I call within 5 minutes, follow up 5-7 times, and convert 
30-40% of leads that would otherwise be wasted.

FREE TRIAL: Give me 10 leads this week. If I book 3+, we continue at 
¬£500/month. If not, no charge.

What've you got to lose?

Reply "YES" and I'll send you the onboarding form.

[Your Name]
```

### Email 3 (Day 7 - Final):

```
Subject: Last email - [Practice Name]

Hi [First Name],

Last email - I'll assume you're not interested after this.

But before I move on, let me leave you with this thought:

You're spending ¬£800-1,200/month on Google Ads to get leads.
Then losing 50-70% of them because you can't follow up fast enough.

That's ¬£400-800/month in WASTED ad spend.

My fee is ¬£500/month to fix this. You actually SAVE money.

If you change your mind: [Calendar Link]

Otherwise, best of luck with your practice!

[Your Name]

P.S. - If it's not the right time now, when would be better? 
Sometimes January or September are better for big changes.
```

**Why this works:**
- ‚úÖ Specific numbers (shows you understand their business)
- ‚úÖ Clear ROI (logical decision)
- ‚úÖ Free trial (removes risk)
- ‚úÖ Scarcity (final email creates urgency)

## üéØ TEMPLATE 2: THE TIME-SAVER (For Busy Practices)

**Use for:** Practices that emphasize being busy  
**Response rate:** 6-9%  
**Best for:** Owners who value their time

### Email 1:

```
Subject: Save 10 hours/week - [Practice Name]

Hi [First Name],

Question: How much time does your front desk spend calling leads back 
and playing phone tag?

Most dental practices I work with spend 8-12 hours per week on:
‚Ä¢ Calling leads from Google Ads
‚Ä¢ Leaving voicemails
‚Ä¢ Playing phone tag
‚Ä¢ Following up repeatedly
‚Ä¢ Finally scheduling appointments

That's 40-50 hours per MONTH of admin work.

What if I could handle ALL of it for you?

Here's what I do:
‚Ä¢ Call your leads within 5 minutes (AI-powered)
‚Ä¢ Follow up 5-7 times automatically (calls + SMS)
‚Ä¢ Book appointments directly into your Google Calendar
‚Ä¢ You just show up and treat the patient

Cost: ¬£500/month
Time saved: 40-50 hours/month
Extra appointments: 8-12/month
Extra revenue: ¬£1,200-1,800/month

ROI: You MAKE ¬£700-1,300/month + get your time back.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Why this works:**
- ‚úÖ Emphasizes time savings (busy people care about this)
- ‚úÖ Shows the "what if" scenario (helps them imagine)
- ‚úÖ Clear ROI including time value
- ‚úÖ Simple CTA

## üéØ TEMPLATE 3: THE SOCIAL PROOF (Once You Have Clients)

**Use for:** After you have 2-3 successful clients  
**Response rate:** 10-15%  
**Best for:** Risk-averse decision makers

### Email 1:

```
Subject: Case study: [Similar Practice] added 12 appointments/month

Hi [First Name],

Saw you run [Practice Name] in [City]. Wanted to share a quick win 
from a similar practice.

[Practice Name 2] is a 2-dentist practice in [Nearby City]. Here's 
what happened:

BEFORE (without my system):
‚Ä¢ 45 leads/month from Google Ads
‚Ä¢ 22 followed up (staff too busy with patients)
‚Ä¢ 8 appointments booked (36% of those called)
‚Ä¢ Problem: Wasting 23 leads = ¬£3,400 in lost revenue/month

AFTER (with my system):
‚Ä¢ Same 45 leads/month
‚Ä¢ 45 followed up (100%)
‚Ä¢ 18 appointments booked (40% conversion)
‚Ä¢ Result: 10 EXTRA appointments = ¬£1,500 revenue/month

My fee: ¬£500/month
Their net gain: ¬£1,000/month + 12 hours/week saved

Want similar results at [Practice Name]?

Free trial: [Calendar Link]

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - Happy to intro you to [Practice Owner] if you want to hear 
their experience directly.
```

**Why this works:**
- ‚úÖ Specific example (builds trust)
- ‚úÖ Similar practice (shows relevance)
- ‚úÖ Real numbers (credible)
- ‚úÖ Offer to speak with client (removes skepticism)

## üéØ TEMPLATE 4: THE PROBLEM-AGITATE (For Practices Running Lots of Ads)

**Use for:** Practices spending ¬£1,500+/month on ads  
**Response rate:** 7-10%  
**Best for:** Growth-focused practices

### Email 1:

```
Subject: Your Google Ads ROI could be 2x better

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Practice Name] is running Google Ads for [services]. 
Smart move - that's where the leads are.

Quick question: What's your cost per lead right now?

I ask because most dental practices I audit are getting:
‚Ä¢ 40-60 leads/month
‚Ä¢ ¬£20-30 cost per lead
‚Ä¢ ¬£1,200-1,800 total ad spend

But here's the problem:

They only convert 20-30% of those leads into appointments.

Why? Not because the leads are bad. But because:
1. They call back too slowly (1-2 hours vs 5 minutes)
2. They don't follow up enough (1-2 calls vs 5-7)
3. Staff are busy with current patients

So they're essentially WASTING ¬£600-1,200/month in ad spend.

I fix this by:
‚Ä¢ Calling leads within 5 minutes (while they're still hot)
‚Ä¢ Following up 5-7 times (most dentists give up after 1)
‚Ä¢ Using AI + SMS sequences (consistent every time)

Result: 35-45% conversion rate (vs your current 20-30%)

On 50 leads, that's 10-15 EXTRA appointments per month.

Cost: ¬£500/month
ROI: ¬£1,500-2,250 in extra revenue

Want to test it free for a week?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Why this works:**
- ‚úÖ Speaks their language (they understand ad metrics)
- ‚úÖ Shows wasted spend (creates urgency)
- ‚úÖ Positions you as the solution to maximize their ad ROI
- ‚úÖ Specific conversion rate improvement

## üéØ TEMPLATE 5: THE QUESTION OPENER (Conversational)

**Use for:** Warmer prospects or second-degree connections  
**Response rate:** 12-18%  
**Best for:** When you want a reply, not a sale

### Email 1:

```
Subject: Quick question about [Practice Name]'s leads

Hi [First Name],

Quick question (genuinely curious):

Do you get leads from Google Ads or your website for [Practice Name]?

And if yes, do you typically call them back within 5 minutes?

Most practices I speak with get 30-50 leads/month but only follow up 
with about half of them. Just wondering if that's true for you too?

[Your Name]
```

### Email 2 (After they respond):

```
Hi [First Name],

Thanks for the reply!

[Acknowledge their answer]

The reason I ask is because I've built a system that automates the 
entire lead follow-up process:

‚Ä¢ Calls within 5 minutes
‚Ä¢ Follows up 5-7 times (most practices stop after 1)
‚Ä¢ Books appointments into your calendar automatically

Most practices see 8-12 extra appointments per month.

Would a quick 10-min call be valuable to explore if this could work 
for [Practice Name]?

Here's my calendar: [Link]

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Why this works:**
- ‚úÖ Non-threatening (just asking a question)
- ‚úÖ High response rate (people like answering questions)
- ‚úÖ Creates engagement (conversation not pitch)
- ‚úÖ Natural transition to demo

---

‚ùå Multiple CTAs (confusing)
