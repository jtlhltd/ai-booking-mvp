DEMO SCRIPT FOR STAY FOCUSED FITNESS
---

**[0:00-0:12]** HOOK - GRAB ATTENTION
"Hi Chris, quick question - how many leads did Stay Focused Fitness 
get last week that you never followed up with? 

**[PAUSE - Let them think]**

Because I just set up something for you that turns those missed leads into 
booked appointments automatically. Want to see it?"

**[0:12-0:25]** THE PAIN - MAKE IT REAL
"Here's what I see with Health & Fitness businesses in Birmingham: 
Most fitness businesses lose 60-70% of leads because people call after hours or during classes when you can't answer.

Someone sees your Instagram at 9pm, calls, gets voicemail, and moves on. That lead is gone forever.

That's why I built this - watch what happens when a lead comes in..."

**[0:25-0:40]** SHOW DASHBOARD - BUILD ANTICIPATION
**[Screen share dashboard - zoom in on lead list]**
"See this? This is your dashboard. I've loaded 5 test leads here.
These are real leads - people who filled out your form or called but you couldn't reach.

Now watch what happens in the next 30 seconds..."

**[0:40-1:15]** THE MAGIC - LIVE DEMO
"Within 5 minutes of a lead coming in, our AI calls them. 
**[Click 'Make Call' or show call in progress]**

**[When call connects - answer as the lead]**
**[AI books appointment naturally - let it flow]**

**[After call ends]**
"Did you hear that? It sounded completely natural. It handled the 
conversation, answered questions, and booked an appointment - all 
without you lifting a finger."

**[1:15-1:30]** SHOW THE RESULT - PROVE IT WORKS
**[Switch to calendar view]**
"Look - it's already in your calendar. The appointment is locked in. Your client knows exactly when to show up.

**[Switch to SMS view if available]**
"And the lead just got this confirmation text. They know exactly when 
to show up. Zero work for you."

**[1:30-1:45]** THE NUMBERS - BUILD URGENCY
**[Show dashboard metrics - highlight conversion rate]**
"Here's what this means: 5 leads, 3 calls made, 2 appointments booked. That's a 40% conversion rate.

Most Health & Fitness businesses get 10-15% conversion. 
You're seeing 40% here. That's 2-3x 
more appointments from the same leads."

**[1:45-2:00]** STRONG CLOSE - CLEAR NEXT STEP
"I've already set this up for Stay Focused Fitness - your assistant is ready, 
your calendar is connected, everything's done.

Here's what I'm proposing: Let's test this with 10 of your actual leads 
this week. If it works, great. If not, no charge. Takes 5 minutes to 
upload the leads.

Sound good? Just reply 'yes' and I'll send you the link to upload them."

KEY TALKING POINTS:
✓ Works 24/7 - captures leads even at 2am
✓ Handles class bookings, personal training, consultations
✓ Sends automatic reminders - cuts no-shows by 50%

OBJECTION HANDLERS:
- "How much does it cost?" → "Let's see if it works first. If you book 
  more appointments, we'll talk pricing. Fair?"
- "Is this really AI?" → "Yes, but listen to that call - could you tell? 
  That's the point. It works 24/7, never gets tired, and converts better 
  than most humans."
- "I need to think about it" → "Totally understand. That's why I'm offering 
  a free test with 10 leads. No commitment, just see if it works. Takes 5 
  minutes. Why not?"
