DEMO SCRIPT FOR D2D XPRESS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[0:00-0:12] HOOK - GRAB ATTENTION
"Hi Tom, quick question - how many leads did D2D Xpress 
get last week that you never followed up with? 

[PAUSE - Let them think]

Because I just set up something for you that turns those missed leads into 
booked appointments automatically. Want to see it?"

[0:12-0:25] THE PAIN - MAKE IT REAL
"Here's what I see with Shipping businesses in Manchester: 
Most businesses lose 60-70% of leads because they can't follow up fast enough or when leads are ready to book.

A lead calls when you're busy, gets voicemail, and moves on to a competitor who answers.

That's why I built this - watch what happens when a lead comes in..."

[0:25-0:40] SHOW DASHBOARD - BUILD ANTICIPATION
[Screen share dashboard - zoom in on lead list]
"See this? This is your dashboard. I've loaded 5 test leads here.
These are real leads - people who showed interest but you couldn't reach.

Now watch what happens in the next 30 seconds..."

[0:40-1:15] THE MAGIC - LIVE DEMO
"Within 5 minutes of a lead coming in, our AI calls them. 
[Click 'Make Call' or show call in progress]

[When call connects - answer as the lead]
[AI books appointment naturally - let it flow]

[After call ends]
"Did you hear that? It sounded completely natural. It handled the 
conversation, answered questions, and booked an appointment - all 
without you lifting a finger."

[1:15-1:30] SHOW THE RESULT - PROVE IT WORKS
[Switch to calendar view]
"Look - it's already in your calendar. The appointment is confirmed. Your client has all the details.

[Switch to SMS view if available]
"And the lead just got this confirmation text. They know exactly when 
to show up. Zero work for you."

[1:30-1:45] THE NUMBERS - BUILD URGENCY
[Show dashboard metrics - highlight conversion rate]
"Here's what this means: 5 leads, 3 calls made, 2 appointments booked. That's a 40% conversion rate.

Most Shipping businesses get 10-20% conversion. 
You're seeing 40% here. That's 2-3x 
more appointments from the same leads."

[1:45-2:00] STRONG CLOSE - CLEAR NEXT STEP
"I've already set this up for D2D Xpress - your assistant is ready, 
your calendar is connected, everything's done.

Here's what I'm proposing: Let's test this with 10 of your actual leads 
this week. If it works, great. If not, no charge. Takes 5 minutes to 
upload the leads.

Sound good? Just reply 'yes' and I'll send you the link to upload them."

[2:00] END

KEY TALKING POINTS:
✓ Works 24/7 - never misses a lead
✓ Natural conversations that convert better
✓ Automatic confirmations and reminders

OBJECTION HANDLERS:
- "How much does it cost?" → "Let's see if it works first. If you book 
  more appointments, we'll talk pricing. Fair?"
- "Is this really AI?" → "Yes, but listen to that call - could you tell? 
  That's the point. It works 24/7, never gets tired, and converts better 
  than most humans."
- "I need to think about it" → "Totally understand. That's why I'm offering 
  a free test with 10 leads. No commitment, just see if it works. Takes 5 
  minutes. Why not?"
