# Minimal Test Schema for VAPI

## Try This First - Simple Schema

Skip the arrays for now. Create a VERY simple schema to test if structured outputs work at all:

### Properties to Add:

1. **businessName** (String)
   - Type: String
   - Required: ✓
   - Description: "Name of the business"

2. **phone** (String)
   - Type: String
   - Required: ✓
   - Description: "Business phone number"

3. **email** (String)
   - Type: String
   - Required: ☐ (optional)
   - Description: "Email address"

### NO ARRAYS YET

Don't add `mainCouriers` or `mainCountries` yet.

### Test This First

1. Add just these 3 simple String fields
2. Click Save
3. If this works, arrays are the problem
4. If this fails, there's a bigger issue
