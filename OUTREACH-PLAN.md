## üéØ EMAIL TEMPLATES (Quick Reference)

### **Template 1: The ROI Hammer (Best Performer)**
Use for: Cold outreach to decision makers

```
Subject: Quick math problem - [Practice Name]

Hi [First Name],

Saw [Practice Name] on Google - nice website! Quick question:

You probably get 30-50 leads per month from Google Ads, right?

Here's what I see with most dental practices:
‚Ä¢ Get 40 leads/month (¬£800-1,200 in ad spend)
‚Ä¢ Actually follow up with ~20 (staff too busy)
‚Ä¢ Convert ~6 appointments (30% of the ones you call)

WASTED: 20 leads = 6 more appointments = ¬£900-1,200/month lost revenue

I can fix this for ¬£500/month.

How? I call ALL your leads within 5 minutes, follow up 5-7 times via calls + SMS, 
and book appointments into your calendar.

Most practices see 8-12 EXTRA appointments/month = ¬£1,200-1,800 revenue.

Want to try it free for a week? I'll prove it works with your leads.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Phone]
[Calendar Link]

P.S. - This isn't lead generation. I work with YOUR existing leads from your ads.
```

### **Template 2: The Follow-Up (Day 3)**
```
Subject: Re: Quick math problem - [Practice Name]

Hi [First Name],

Following up on my email from Monday.

I get it - you're busy treating patients. That's exactly the problem, right?

Here's what's happening: Every day 2-3 leads come in from your Google Ads. Your 
staff tries to call them back, but by then (1-2 hours later), 50% have already 
called another dentist.

Meanwhile, I call within 5 minutes and convert 30-40% of leads that would 
otherwise be wasted.

FREE TRIAL: Give me 10 leads this week. If I book 3+, we continue at ¬£500/month. 
If not, no charge.

Reply "YES" and I'll send you the onboarding form.

[Your Name]
```

### **Template 3: The Final Follow-Up (Day 7)**
```
Subject: Last email - [Practice Name]

Hi [First Name],

Last email - I'll assume you're not interested after this.

But before I move on: You're spending ¬£800-1,200/month on Google Ads to get leads. 
Then losing 50-70% of them because you can't follow up fast enough. That's ¬£400-800/month 
in WASTED ad spend.

My fee is ¬£500/month to fix this. You actually SAVE money.

If you change your mind: [Calendar Link]

Otherwise, best of luck with your practice!

[Your Name]
```

## üí¨ LINKEDIN MESSAGE TEMPLATES

### **Template 1: Question Opener (Best Performer)**
```
Hi [First Name],

Thanks for connecting!

Quick question: Does [Practice Name] get leads from Google Ads or your website?

Most practices I speak with generate 30-50 leads/month but only follow up with 
about half (staff too busy with current patients).

Just curious if that's true for you too?

Cheers,
[Your Name]
```

### **Template 2: Case Study (After You Have Clients)**
```
Hi [First Name],

Thanks for connecting giving business advice !

Quick case study: I recently helped [Similar Practice] go from 8 ‚Üí 20 appointments 
per month from their Google Ads leads.

The difference? Calling leads within 5 minutes (vs 1-2 hours) and following up 
5-7 times (vs giving up after 1 call).

Would similar results be valuable for [Practice Name]?

Happy to share the full case study if interested.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### **Template 3: Follow-Up (After Connection)**
```
Hi [First Name],

I get it - you're busy. That's exactly the problem my system solves.

Would 8-12 extra appointments per month be valuable for [Practice Name]?

If yes: [Calendar Link]
If no: No worries!

Cheers,
[Your Name]
```

## üö´ COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

### **Objection 1: "Too Expensive"**
```
Response: "I understand ¬£500/month sounds like a lot. Let's look at the math:

If I book just 4 extra appointments at ¬£125 each, that's ¬£500 - we break even.
Most clients see 8-12 extra bookings = ¬£1,000-1,500 in revenue.

So you're actually MAKING ¬£500-1,000/month, not spending ¬£500.

Plus you save 10+ hours/week in admin time.

Want to try it free for a week to prove the math works?"
```

### **Objection 2: "We Already Follow Up"**
```
Response: "That's great! Quick questions:
1. How quickly do you typically call leads back? (Most: 1-2 hours)
2. How many times do you follow up? (Most: 1-2 times)

Here's what I do differently:
‚Ä¢ Call within 5 minutes (vs 1-2 hours)
‚Ä¢ Follow up 5-7 times (vs 1-2)
‚Ä¢ 100% consistent (AI never has a bad day)

Even good practices improve conversion by 20-30%.

On 40 leads, that's 8-12 extra appointments.

Worth testing for free?"
```

### **Objection 3: "I Need to Think About It"**
```
Response: "Of course! What specifically do you need to think about?

[Explore their actual concern]

Here's the thing: Every week you wait, you're losing 10-15 leads that could've 
been appointments.

How about this: Book the free trial now, and if you need to think about it during 
the trial week, you can. No commitment.

Fair?"
```

### **Objection 4: "I Don't Trust AI"**
```
Response: "Totally fair - I get it. A lot of people picture robot voices.

Here's how it actually works:
‚Ä¢ The AI sounds completely natural (Vapi is industry-leading)
‚Ä¢ I oversee EVERY call and intervene if needed
‚Ä¢ The AI follows a script I customize for YOUR practice
‚Ä¢ If someone asks a complex question, I handle it personally

It's not 100% AI - it's AI + human oversight.

The AI just handles the repetitive stuff: dialing, following up, scheduling.

Want to hear a demo call? I can play you one right now."
```

### **Objection 5: "We Don't Get Many Leads"**
```
Response: "How many do you typically get per month?
[Usually: 10-20]

Perfect - that's actually easier for me. I can give each lead MORE attention.

Plus, if you're only getting 10-20 leads, you REALLY can't afford AAA company among giants 
to waste any, right?

At 10 leads/month and 30% conversion = 3 appointments.
With my system at 50% conversion = 5 appointments.
That's 2 EXTRA worth ¬£300.

My fee is ¬£500, but you can scale up your ad spend once you're converting better.

Make sense?"
```
