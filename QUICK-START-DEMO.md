# üöÄ QUICK START - See Everything in Action

## üìå **YOU'RE CONFUSED BECAUSE WE BUILT 2 DIFFERENT SYSTEMS:**

### **SYSTEM 2: CLIENT Service** (What clients pay for)

Let me show you how to use both.

# üéØ **DEMO 1: FIND CLIENTS TO SELL TO** (Your Sales)

## **What you're doing:** Finding businesses to sell your ¬£799/month service to

### **Step 1: Find Prospects (2 minutes)**

---

### **Step 2: Call Them (Using Your Sales Script)**
Pick the top 10 (highest scores) and call/email them with:

**Email (from SALES-MATERIALS.md):**
```
Subject: Are you losing 80% of your leads?

Hi [Name],

Quick question: how many leads do you get per month from ads/referrals?

And how many actually become customers?

We take your existing leads and convert 30-40% into booked appointments using AI.

- They just work automatically

- 2 are for clients

**The Menu (Documentation):**
- 5 guides
- Read when you need them

## **Never:**
