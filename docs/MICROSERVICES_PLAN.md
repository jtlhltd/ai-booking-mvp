# Microservices Architecture Plan

## Current Status: MONOLITHIC üèóÔ∏è
- Single Node.js application
- All services in one codebase
- Shared database
- Single deployment unit

## Proposed Microservices Structure:

### **Core Services:**
1. **API Gateway** - Request routing, authentication, rate limiting
2. **Client Service** - Client management, onboarding
3. **Lead Service** - Lead management, scoring, deduplication
4. **Call Service** - Call management, VAPI integration
5. **SMS Service** - SMS handling, Twilio integration
6. **Calendar Service** - Calendar integration, booking
7. **Notification Service** - Email, SMS, push notifications
8. **Analytics Service** - Metrics, reporting, dashboards

### **Infrastructure Services:**
1. **User Service** - Authentication, authorization
2. **Audit Service** - Logging, compliance
3. **Config Service** - Configuration management
4. **Health Service** - Health checks, monitoring

### **Benefits:**
- Independent scaling
- Technology diversity
- Fault isolation
- Team autonomy
- Faster deployment

### **Challenges:**
- Increased complexity
- Network latency
- Data consistency
- Service discovery
- Monitoring complexity

## Migration Strategy:
1. **Phase 1**: Extract client service
2. **Phase 2**: Extract lead service
3. **Phase 3**: Extract call service
4. **Phase 4**: Extract remaining services
