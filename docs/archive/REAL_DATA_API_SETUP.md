**Instead of**: "john.smith@company.co.uk (Generated)"
**You'll get**: "sarah.johnson@realcompany.co.uk (Based on real name)"

**Instead of**: "85% confidence (Simulated)"
**You'll get**: "90% confidence (Official Companies House data)"

1. **Companies House API is FREE** - No cost, just requires registration
2. **Rate Limits**: Companies House allows 600 requests/hour
