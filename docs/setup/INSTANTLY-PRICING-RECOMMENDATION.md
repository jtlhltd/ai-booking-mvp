## 💡 MY ACTUAL RECOMMENDATION

### **Start with Option 1: Free Tools**

**Here's Why:**

1. **You need 5,000 leads total** for your campaign
2. **150 credits/month is too little** (would take 33 months!)
3. **$84/month is too expensive** (2.27x your email cost)
4. **You can get leads free** with 5-10 hours work

**Math:**
- Free tools: $37/month, 5-10 hours = 500 leads
- Instantly Credits: $84/month, 2 hours = 1,500 leads
- Difference: $47/month saved = $564/year saved!
