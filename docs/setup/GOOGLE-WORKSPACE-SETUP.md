## ⚙️ RECOMMENDED SETTINGS

**For Your Google Workspace Account:**

**Daily Sending Limit:**
- Start with: **20-30 emails/day**
- Never exceed: **100 emails/day** from one Gmail account
- Why? Google can flag/suspend if you send too many cold emails from one account

**Warm-Up Period:**
- Week 1: 10 emails/day max
- Week 2: 20 emails/day
- Week 3: 30 emails/day
- Week 4+: 30-50 emails/day (sustainable)
- Gradually increase to avoid Google flags

**Reply Monitoring:**
- ✅ Enable "Sync Replies" (auto-detects responses)
- ✅ Enable "Stop on Reply" (pauses follow-up sequence)

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: GMAIL COLD EMAIL RISKS

**Potential Issues:**
- Google might temporarily restrict sending if you send too many cold emails
- Could affect your regular business emails
- Account suspension possible if flagged as spam

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**1. Start Slow**
- Don't send 100 emails on day 1
- Gradually increase volume

**2. Keep Under Gmail Limits**
- Gmail free: 500/day
- Google Workspace: 2,000/day
- But for cold email: stick to 50-100/day max per account

**3. Monitor Deliverability**
- Watch spam scores in Instantly dashboard
- If bounce rate > 5%, slow down

**4. Consider Add-On**
- Instantly.ai offers "Email Warm-Up" service
- Gradually increases your sending volume
- Improves deliverability

## 💡 ALTERNATIVE: MULTIPLE EMAIL ACCOUNTS

**If You Want to Send More:**

**Option 1: Additional Gmail Accounts**
- Create 2-3 additional Gmail accounts (free)
- Connect each to Instantly
- Spread sending across accounts
- Each account: 30/day = 90/day total

**Option 2: Purchase Additional Google Workspace Accounts**
- Add extra users to your Workspace ($6-12/month each)
- example@jtlhmedia.com, info@jtlhmedia.com, etc.
- Connect each to Instantly
- Spread sending across all

**Option 3: Use Instantly's Pre-Warmed Accounts**
- Instantly provides ready-to-use email accounts
- Already warmed up and deliverability-optimized
- Costs extra but safer for high-volume sending
