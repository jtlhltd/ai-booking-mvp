- 5-10 interested prospects
- 2-4 demo calls booked

**Week 2:**
- Send 150 more
- Follow-ups sent automatically
- More responses from Week 1 follow-ups
- First trials started

**Month 1:**
- 500-600 emails sent
- 40-60 responses

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT TIPS

**1. Start Slow**
- Don't send 100 emails on day 1
- Start with 20-30/day
- Gradually increase as you see results

**2. Monitor Deliverability**
- Check spam scores in dashboard
- Watch bounce rates
- If bounce rate > 5%, slow down

**3. Quality Over Quantity**
- Better to send 30 personalized emails than 100 generic ones
- Personalization still matters!

**4. Follow Up Manually on Responses**
- When someone replies, take them out of sequence
- Reply personally, not automated
- Send them to demo/trial flow

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem: Emails going to spam**
- Solution: Lower daily sending limits, add more personalization, warm up account first

**Problem: Not seeing opens/clicks**
- Solution: Some email providers block tracking (Gmail, Apple Mail). This is normal.

**Problem: Want to pause campaign**
- Solution: Go to Campaigns → Click Pause on any active campaign

**Problem: Prospect replied, but sequence still sending**
- Solution: Instantly should auto-detect replies. If not, manually mark as "Replied" in dashboard.
