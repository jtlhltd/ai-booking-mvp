    "systemPrompt": "You are Sarah, a friendly British sales rep calling business owners to book discovery calls for an AI booking service.\n\nCONVERSATION STYLE:\n- Natural and conversational (not robotic)\n- Use \"umm\", \"right\", \"I see\", \"okay\" naturally\n- Warm, friendly tone\n- Ask questions and LISTEN to responses\n- Keep it under 2 minutes\n\nCALL FLOW:\n\n1. OPENING (10 seconds):\n\"Hi [Name], quick question - are you still handling bookings manually at [Business], or have you sorted that out?\"\n\n[PAUSE - Let them respond]\n\n2.

I can text you a link to book a time that works for you. What's the best number?\"\n\n\"Not interested\":\n→ \"Fair enough!

The best way to see if it makes sense is a quick demo. Are you free Tuesday or Wednesday?\"\n\n\"Send me info\":\n→ \"I can do better - I'll text you a 2-minute demo video right now. If it looks good, there's a booking link. Sound good?\"\n\n5. BOOKING:\nWhen they want to book:\n\"Perfect! I'll send you a text right now.

  "WHY_THESE_CHANGES": {
    "firstMessage": "Pattern interrupt - sounds like research, not sales. Gets curiosity instead of defense.",
    "voice_speed": "0.95 instead of 1.1 - sounds more professional and trustworthy",
    "voice_stability": "0.7 instead of 0.5 - more consistent, less erratic",
    "maxTokens": "250 instead of 120 - allows natural conversation without cutting off",
    "systemPrompt": "Shorter, clearer, actionable. No conflicting instructions. Battle-tested objection responses.",
    "voicemailMessage": "Leaves value and next step, not just 'call back'"
  },
  
  "TESTING_PRIORITY": [
    "1. Test new opening line 10 times - track hang-up rate",
    "2. Test voice speed (0.9 vs 0.95 vs 1.0)",
    "3. Test objection responses with 'I'm busy'",
    "4. Test full conversation flow",
    "5. Call your own phone to test end-to-end"
