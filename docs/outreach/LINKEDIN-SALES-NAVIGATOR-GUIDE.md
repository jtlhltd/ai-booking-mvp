---

## 📊 WEEK 1: ORGANIZE WITH LEAD LISTS

### **The 3-List System:**

**List 1: "Priority - This Week"**
- Top 50 prospects you'll contact this week
- Practice owners in your target cities
- Active on LinkedIn (posted recently)
- Mutual connections (if any)

**List 2: "Follow-Up Queue"**
- Prospects you've already contacted
- Waiting for response
- Need follow-up message

**List 3: "Future Outreach"**
- Prospects you'll contact next week
- Lower priority but still qualified
- Backup list when List 1 runs dry

**How to Create:**
1. In Sales Navigator → Click "Lists"
2. Click "Create List"
3. Name it
4. Add prospects from saved searches

**Pro Tip:** Add 50-100 prospects to each list, rotate weekly.

---

## 💬 SALES NAVIGATOR OUTREACH METHODS

### **METHOD 1: Connection Request + Message (Standard)**

**Same as Free LinkedIn, but with better targeting:**

1. Open your saved search or lead list
2. Click "Connect" (with or without note - I recommend WITHOUT)
3. Wait 2-3 days for acceptance
4. Send message (use templates from LINKEDIN-OUTREACH-GUIDE.md)

**Volume:**
- 50-75 connection requests/day (Sales Navigator allows more)
- But be smart: Still do 30-50/day to avoid restrictions

---

### **METHOD 2: InMail (Game Changer - NO Connection Needed!)**

**What InMail Does:**
- Messages people you're NOT connected to
- Bypasses connection request entirely
- Up to 50 credits/month (reset monthly)
- Higher response rate (25-35% vs 20% for messages)

**When to Use InMail:**
- ✅ High-value prospects (large practices, multiple locations)
- ✅ Decision makers (Practice Owners, Partners)
- ✅ Prospects you can't find email for
- ✅ Warm-ish prospects (viewed your profile, mutual connections)

**When NOT to Use:**
- ❌ Low-value prospects (save credits)
- ❌ People you can connect with normally
- ❌ Prospects you have email for (email is free!)

**InMail Template (Short & Direct):**

```
Hi [First Name],

I help dental practices like [Practice Name] convert MORE of their Google 
Ads leads into booked appointments.

Most practices only follow up with 50% of leads because staff are busy 
with current patients.

I call YOUR leads within 5 minutes, follow up 5-7 times, and book 
appointments into your calendar.

Most practices see 8-12 extra appointments/month.

Would a 10-min call be valuable to explore if this could work for you?

[Your Calendar Link]

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Short (under 200 words - InMail limit)
- ✅ Specific value proposition
- ✅ Clear next step
- ✅ No fluff (they're busy)

**InMail Best Practices:**
1. **Personalize:** Mention their practice name (not generic)
2. **Keep it short:** 150-200 words max
3. **Clear CTA:** Calendar link, not "tell me more"
4. **Send Tuesday-Thursday:** Higher open rates
5. **Follow up:** If no response, connect and send regular message (save InMail credits!)

**Monthly Strategy:**
```
50 InMail credits/month
→ Use 10-15/week
→ 40-60 high-value prospects/month
→ Expected: 10-20 responses (25-35% response)
→ Expected: 5-10 demos
→ Expected: 2-4 clients
```

---

### **METHOD 3: InMail Follow-Up Sequence**

**If they don't respond to InMail:**

**Day 5: Connection Request**
- They saw your InMail
- Now connect (mention you sent InMail)
- Higher acceptance rate!

**Message with Connection:**
```
Hi [Name],

I sent you an InMail last week about helping [Practice Name] convert more 
of your Google Ads leads into appointments.

Would love to connect and share a quick case study.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Day 10: Regular Message (if connected)**
- Follow up on original message
- Reference the InMail
- Push for demo call

---

## 🔔 SALES NAVIGATOR NOTIFICATIONS (Your Secret Weapon)

### **Set Up Lead Notifications:**

1. In Sales Navigator → Click any prospect → "Save Lead"
2. Click "Alerts" → Enable notifications for:
   - ✅ Profile updates (job changes, promotions)
   - ✅ Job changes
   - ✅ Work anniversaries
   - ✅ Shared connections
   - ✅ Posted content
   - ✅ In the news

**Why This Matters:**
- **Job changes** = Perfect time to reach out (new role = new priorities)
- **Posted content** = Engage immediately (comments = warm intro)
- **Work anniversaries** = Congratulate them (opens door)
- **Shared connections** = Ask for intro

**Example Uses:**

**When They Post Content:**
1. See notification
2. Comment thoughtfully on their post (add value, don't pitch)
3. Wait 2 hours
4. Send InMail or message: "Saw your post about X - great insight! I help dental practices..."

**When They Change Jobs:**
1. See notification
2. InMail: "Congrats on your new role at [Practice]! Quick question: Do you plan to focus on lead conversion there?"

**When They Have Work Anniversary:**
1. See notification
2. Message: "Congrats on [X] years at [Practice]! That's impressive. I help practices like yours..."

**Time:** 5 minutes/day to check notifications
**Result:** 2-3x higher response rate (warm outreach vs cold)

## 🎯 SALES NAVIGATOR ADVANCED TACTICS

### **TACTIC 1: TeamLink (Mutual Connections)**

**What It Does:**
Shows you who in your network can introduce you to prospects.

**How to Use:**
1. Click on any prospect in Sales Navigator
2. Look at "TeamLink" section (shows mutual connections)
3. If you see a good mutual connection:
   - Message your connection: "Do you know [Prospect] at [Practice]? I help dental practices..."
   - Ask for intro (higher conversion rate!)

**Example Message to Mutual Connection:**
```
Hi [Connection],

I see you're connected to [Prospect Name] at [Practice Name]. I help dental 
practices convert more of their Google Ads leads into booked appointments.

Would you be comfortable introducing me, or would you prefer I reach out 
directly and mention we're connected?

Thanks!
[Your Name]
```

**Why This Works:**
- 60-70% response rate (vs 20-25% cold)
- Social proof (mutual connection = trust)
- Warmer intro

---

### **TACTIC 2: Account-Based Outreach**

**Instead of reaching out to one person at a practice:**
1. Find the practice in Sales Navigator
2. See all employees (click "People" tab)
3. Connect with Owner + Manager (target both decision makers)
4. Coordinate messages (reference each other)

**Message to Owner:**
```
Hi [Owner Name],

I help dental practices like [Practice Name] convert more of their Google 
Ads leads into appointments.

Quick question: Is [Manager Name] the right person to speak with about 
lead follow-up, or would it be better to chat with you directly?
```

**Message to Manager:**
```
Hi [Manager Name],

I'm connecting with [Owner Name] about lead follow-up for [Practice Name].

Are you the person handling lead conversion there? Would love to share a 
quick case study if relevant.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Multiple touchpoints at same practice
- Different decision makers see different angles
- Increases odds of getting in

---

### **TACTIC 3: Saved Searches by Intent Signals**

**Create searches for prospects likely to buy:**

**Search: "Recently Promoted"**
```
Recent Activity: Profile updated in last 30 days
Title: "Practice Owner" OR "Manager"
Location: United Kingdom
```
*Why: New role = new priorities = open to new solutions*

**Search: "Posted About Growth"**
```
Recent Activity: Posted in last 30 days
Title: "Practice Owner"
Keywords in posts: "growth", "leads", "appointments", "marketing"
```
*Why: If they're posting about growth, they need help*

**Search: "Company Size Increase"**
```
Title: "Practice Owner"
Company: Headcount increased in last 6 months
```
*Why: Growing practices = need systems = need your service*

---

### **TACTIC 4: InMail A/B Testing**

**Test 2 versions of InMail:**

**Version A: Problem-Focused**
```
Hi [Name],

Most dental practices waste 50% of their Google Ads leads by not 
following up quickly enough.

Do you struggle with this at [Practice Name]?

I fix it. Would a 10-min call be valuable?
[Calendar Link]
```

**Version B: Solution-Focused**
```
Hi [Name],

I help dental practices like [Practice Name] book 8-12 extra 
appointments per month from their existing leads.

The secret? Calling within 5 minutes and following up 5-7 times 
(most practices only do 1-2).

Would a quick call be valuable?
[Calendar Link]
```

**Test:**
- Send Version A to 20 prospects
- Send Version B to 20 prospects
- Track response rate
- Use winner going forward

## 📊 TRACKING IN SALES NAVIGATOR

### **Use Lead Lists to Track Status:**

**Create Lists by Status:**
1. "InMail Sent - Week 1"
2. "Connected - Need Message"
3. "Messaged - Waiting Response"
4. "Responded - Demo Scheduled"
5. "Demo Completed - Follow-Up"
6. "Trial Started"
7. "Client - Active"

**How to Use:**
1. When you send InMail → Add to "InMail Sent - Week 1"
2. When they connect → Move to "Connected - Need Message"
3. When you message → Move to "Messaged - Waiting Response"
4. When they respond → Move to "Responded - Demo Scheduled"
5. And so on...

**Why This Works:**
- Visual pipeline in Sales Navigator
- Easy to see where prospects are
- Know who needs follow-up
- No spreadsheet needed (but still track in spreadsheet for metrics!)
