## 📝 HOW TO SET UP IN LINKEDIN SALES NAVIGATOR

### **Step-by-Step:**

1. **Go to Sales Navigator**
   - Click "Sales Navigator" in LinkedIn top menu

2. **Click "Lead Search"** (left sidebar)

3. **Set Your Filters:**
   - **Option A: Use Title Keywords** (if you have Sales Navigator)
     - Click "Title" filter
     - Select "Contains" or "Includes"
     - Paste all keyword variations (separated by OR)
     - Example: "Practice Owner" OR "Dental Practice Owner" OR "Practice Principal"
   
   - **Option B: Use Keywords Filter** (Better for more results!)
     - Click "Keywords" filter (usually at top of filter panel)
     - Paste keyword combinations
     - Example: "dental practice owner" OR "practice owner" OR "dentist owner"
   
   - **Then add:**
     - Location: United Kingdom
     - Company Size: 1-50 employees
     - Industry: (select relevant)
     - Seniority: (if needed)

4. **Review Results**
   - Should show 200-1,500+ prospects
   - **If still getting only 20 results:**
     - Remove some filters (try without Industry filter)
     - Remove Company Size filter temporarily
     - Use Keywords filter instead of Title filter
     - Try just Location + Keywords (broadest search)

5. **Save the Search**
   - Click "Save" at top
   - Name it (use name from guide)
   - This auto-updates daily with new prospects!

6. **Create Lead List**

### **💡 TROUBLESHOOTING: If You're Still Getting Only 20 Results**

**Try This Broader Approach:**

1. **Start with JUST Location + Keywords:**
   ```
   Keywords: "dental practice owner" OR "practice owner" OR "dentist owner"
   Location: United Kingdom
   (Remove all other filters initially)
   ```

2. **Then gradually add filters:**
   - See how many results you get
   - Add Company Size filter if needed
   - Add Industry filter if needed
   - Don't add too many filters at once!

3. **Use Keywords Filter Instead of Title Filter:**
   - Keywords searches the ENTIRE profile (not just title)
   - Much broader results
   - Often better for finding prospects

4. **Try Multiple Variations:**
   - Create separate searches for:
     - "dental practice owner"
     - "practice owner" (broader)
     - "dentist owner"
   - Combine results manually if needed
