# ðŸš¨ Quick Fixes to Reduce Call Costs

## âœ… **JUST FIXED:**
1. âœ… Structured Outputs configuration (arrays were breaking it)
2. âœ… Webhook properly handles structured output data
3. âœ… Google Sheets column mapping

## ðŸ”§ **REMAINING FIXES:**

### **1. Email Collection Script** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Problem:** Assistant going off-script when collecting emails, spelling incorrectly
**Cost Impact:** Failed calls = wasted money
**Status:** In progress

**What we need to do:**
- Update VAPI script with clearer email collection instructions
- Test that it properly confirms emails letter-by-letter
- Ensure it recognizes "@" when user says "at"

### **2. Better Call Quality Detection**
**Problem:** Bad calls aren't flagged automatically
**Cost Impact:** Continues spending on low-quality calls

**Fix:** Add automatic call quality scoring that flags:
- Calls that end < 30 seconds (likely not decision maker)
- Calls with high interruption rate
- Calls with negative sentiment

### **3. Automated A/B Testing**
**Problem:** Not testing different scripts automatically
**Cost Impact:** Using suboptimal scripts costs money

**Fix:** Set up script versioning so we can:
- Test different openings
- Track which performs better
- Automatically use winning version

### **4. Better Lead Validation**
**Problem:** Calling invalid numbers wastes money
**Cost Impact:** Paying for calls that never connect

**Fix:** Add more aggressive validation:
- Check if number is mobile vs landline
- Validate before adding to call queue
- Skip numbers that look fake

### **5. Rate Limiting**
**Problem:** Too many calls too fast might hurt performance
**Cost Impact:** Lower conversion = wasted spend

**Fix:** Add intelligent pacing:
- Max 3 calls per minute
- Batch delays
- Respect business hours

## ðŸŽ¯ **RECOMMENDED ORDER:**

1. **Fix email script** (prevents wasted calls)
2. **Add call quality detection** (identify bad calls)
3. **Better lead validation** (avoid invalid calls)
4. **Rate limiting** (improve conversion)
5. **A/B testing** (optimize performance)

## ðŸ’° **Expected Savings:**

- Email fix: ~20% fewer failed calls
- Call quality: ~15% fewer bad calls
- Lead validation: ~10% fewer invalid calls
- Rate limiting: ~5% better conversion
- **Total: ~50% reduction in wasted call costs**
