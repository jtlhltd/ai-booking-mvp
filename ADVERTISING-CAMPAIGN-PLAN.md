I noticed [Company] runs Google ads for new patients - smart move!

Quick question: Are you following up with every lead within 5 minutes?

Most practices lose 40-60% of leads because staff are too busy to call back quickly.

I've helped similar practices convert 40-50% of leads by using AI to follow up instantly.

Result: 8-12 EXTRA appointments per month.

Best,
