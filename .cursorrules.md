# Cursor Rules â€” Vapi AI-Booking-MVP

- Scope: Modify ONLY the code required to implement the described behavior.
- Non-goals: Do NOT refactor unrelated areas, reformat files globally, or remove logging.
- Backwards-compat: Preserve existing behavior for all tenants unless explicitly stated.
- Logging: Add structured logs using existing patterns; do not delete existing logs.
- Env usage: Touch only env vars already present unless the prompt explicitly adds new ones.
- Data models: Do not change schemas unless explicitly asked; if changed, include migration notes.
- Tests: If logic is added, also add/update lightweight probes or comments that show how to test.
- Diffs: Keep PR-sized changes; avoid multi-file edits unless necessary for the exact feature.

## Commit Style
- Use **Conventional Commits**. Examples:
  - feat(inbound): treat START same as YES (opt-in + auto-call)
  - fix(twilio): guard against missing To number
  - chore(logs): add [LEAD OPT-IN START] marker
