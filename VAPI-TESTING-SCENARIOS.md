## üé¨ **SCENARIO 1: THE OPENING LINE (MOST CRITICAL)**

### **Why This Matters:**
You have **3 SECONDS** before they hang up. Your opening must:
- Sound human (not robotic)
- Be relevant (not spam)
- Create curiosity (not sales pitch)

### **Test Variations:**

#### **Version A: Direct & Professional**
```
"Hi [Name], this is Sarah calling about improving appointment bookings for [Business]. 
Do you have 30 seconds?"
```

#### **Version B: Casual & Friendly**
```
"Hey [Name], it's Sarah! I noticed [Business] does [service] - 
quick question about your booking system, got a sec?"
```

#### **Version C: Value First**
```
"Hi [Name], Sarah here. I help [industry] businesses like [Business] 
fill more appointments. Are you currently handling bookings manually?"
```

### **What To Listen For:**
‚úÖ **Good Signs:**
- Sounds natural and conversational
- Doesn't trigger "sales call" alarm
- Gets a response (even if "what's this about?")
- Voice pace feels right (not too fast/slow)

‚ùå **Bad Signs:**
- Sounds robotic or scripted
- Too long (loses attention)
- Immediate defensive response
- Awkward pauses or rushed delivery

### **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Opening takes 5-7 seconds max
- [ ] Gets engagement ("who is this?" counts as engagement)
- [ ] Doesn't sound like telemarketer
- [ ] You'd answer this call yourself

---

## üí¨ **SCENARIO 2: "I'M BUSY RIGHT NOW"**

### **Why This Matters:**
90% of calls will hear this. Your response determines if they hang up or stay.

### **Your Response Options:**

#### **Version A: Respect + Value**
```
"Totally understand! Here's what I'll do - I'll send you a quick text 
with a link where you can see a 2-minute demo video. Does that work?"
```

#### **Version B: Super Quick Pitch**
```
"No worries! 15 seconds: We make sure every lead that calls you gets 
booked automatically, even at 2am. Sound interesting?"
```

#### **Version C: Schedule Callback**
```
"I get it - when's a better time? I can call you back later today 
or just text you the info now?"
```

### **What To Listen For:**
‚úÖ **Good Signs:**
- Response is immediate (no awkward pause)
- Tone is understanding (not pushy)
- Offers clear next step
- Gives them control

‚ùå **Bad Signs:**
- Keeps talking (ignoring their request)
- Sounds disappointed or pushy
- Doesn't offer alternative
- Makes them repeat themselves

### **Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Offers clear alternative (text/callback)
- [ ] Maintains friendly tone
- [ ] Doesn't pressure them

---

## üö´ **SCENARIO 3: "NOT INTERESTED"**

### **Why This Matters:**
This is a test. Most aren't truly "not interested" - they're testing if you're spam.

### **Your Response Options:**

#### **Version A: Curiosity Hook**
```
"Fair enough! Can I ask - are you happy with how many of your leads 
actually book appointments? Or do some slip through?"
```

#### **Version B: Quick Exit + Value**
```
"No problem at all! Before I go - quick question: 
do you ever get calls after hours that don't get answered?"
```

#### **Version C: Permission-Based**
```
"Totally fine! Would it be helpful if I just sent you a quick 
text showing what we do? No pressure at all."
```

### **What To Listen For:**
‚úÖ **Good Signs:**
- Respectful of their response
- One more try (not aggressive)
- Asks permission to follow up
- Easy exit if still not interested

‚ùå **Bad Signs:**
- Keeps pitching after "not interested"
- Sounds defensive
- Asks "why not interested?"
- Doesn't respect their boundary

### **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Respects their "no"
- [ ] One gentle re-engagement attempt
- [ ] Offers text alternative
- [ ] Ends call gracefully if still no

## üí∞ **SCENARIO 4: "HOW MUCH DOES THIS COST?"**

### **Why This Matters:**
Price question = they're interested! Don't blow it with bad answer.

### **Your Response Options:**

#### **Version A: Value First**
```
"Great question! It depends on your call volume. Most [industry] businesses 
see 3-5x ROI in the first month. Can I ask how many leads you get per week?"
```

#### **Version B: Qualify First**
```
"Happy to share that! Quick question first - what's your biggest challenge 
right now with bookings? Leads not answering? Missing after-hours calls?"
```

#### **Version C: Range + Demo**
```
"Most clients are between $500-2000/month depending on volume, 
but honestly, the best way to see if it makes sense for you is a quick demo. 
Can I send you a booking link?"
```

### **What To Listen For:**
‚úÖ **Good Signs:**
- Doesn't dodge the question
- Ties price to value
- Qualifies before quoting
- Moves toward booking demo

‚ùå **Bad Signs:**
- "It's affordable!" (vague)

- Sounds defensive about cost
- Doesn't address value/ROI

### **Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Provides context (not just number)
- [ ] Qualifies their fit first
- [ ] Pivots to demo booking

## üìß **SCENARIO 5: "JUST SEND ME AN EMAIL"**

### **Why This Matters:**
This is a polite brush-off. Your response determines if they actually engage later.

### **Your Response Options:**

#### **Version A: Text Instead**
```
"I can do you one better - how about I text you a link where you can 
see a quick video demo and book a time if it looks good? What's the best 
number to text?"
```

#### **Version B: Get Commitment**
```
"Absolutely! And I'll include a booking link - if the demo video looks 
interesting, what day works best for a 15-minute call? Tuesday or Wednesday?"
```

#### **Version C: Validate Interest**
```
"For sure! Before I do - is this something you're actually looking to solve 
in the next month or two, or just gathering info?"
```

### **What To Listen For:**
‚úÖ **Good Signs:**
- Doesn't just agree to send email
- Gets phone number for text
- Qualifies actual interest
- Creates next step commitment

‚ùå **Bad Signs:**
- Immediately says "okay, bye!"

- No follow-up action secured
- Misses opportunity to qualify

### **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Offers text alternative (better than email)
- [ ] Gets phone number
- [ ] Qualifies timing/interest
- [ ] Sets expectation for next step

## üìÖ **SCENARIO 6: BOOKING SUCCESS**

### **Why This Matters:**
They're ready to book! Make it crystal clear what happens next.

### **Your Response:**

#### **Perfect Booking Close:**
```
"Perfect! Here's what I'm doing right now - I'm sending you a text message 
to [number]. When you get it, just reply with your email address. 
I'll immediately send you a booking link where you can pick your time. 
Should take 30 seconds total. Sound good?"

50% of calls go to voicemail. Don't waste them!

### **Test This:**

Let the assistant talk to "voicemail" (you stay silent):

#### **Good Voicemail:**
```
"Hi [Name], this is Sarah from AI Booking Solutions. 
I help [industry] businesses like yours capture more appointments 
automatically. I'm going to text you a link to a quick demo video. 
Check it out and book a time if you'd like to chat. Talk soon!"
```
