## 🎭 **TEST 2: Objection Handling** (15 minutes, £0)

During the browser test, **interrupt the AI** and say these objections:

### **Objection 1: "How much does it cost?"**

Test 3 responses:

**Response A (Direct):**
```
"Great question. It's £[X]. Most clients see 3-10x ROI 
in month one. Want to book a time to discuss?"
```

**Response B (Reframe):**
```
"The investment is £[X], and here's why it's worth it: 
[value prop]. Shall we get you started?"
```

**Response C (Trial Close):**
```
"Let's book you a call first so you can decide if it's 
right for you. No pressure. What's your availability?"
```

### **Objection 2: "I need to think about it"**

**Response A (Permission-based):**
```
"Totally understand. What specific concerns can I address 
right now so you have what you need to decide?"
```

**Response B (Create urgency):**
```
"I get it. Just so you know, we're booking up this week. 
Can I at least hold a spot for you while you think?"
```

**Response C (Assumptive):**
```
"Of course. How about I book you for [date] and if you 
need to reschedule, just let me know?"
```

### **How to Test:**
1. Start browser call

5. Rate it 1-10
6. Hang up, switch response

**Time:** 15 minutes

## 🎤 **TEST 3: Voice & Tone** (15 minutes, £0)

### **Test These Variables:**

#### **Voice Selection:**
- Test "Jennifer" (warm, professional)

**Pick the one that sounds most credible for your industry.**

#### **Speed:**
- Test 0.9x (slower, more deliberate)
- Test 1.0x (normal)
- Test 1.1x (faster, more confident)

**Faster often = more professional, but too fast = pushy.**

#### **Temperature:**
- Test 0.5 (predictable, script-like)
- Test 0.7 (balanced - RECOMMENDED)
- Test 0.9 (creative, more natural variations)

**0.7 is usually the sweet spot.**

### **How to Test:**
1. Change voice in Vapi settings
2. Browser test (same script)
3. Does it sound trustworthy?
4. Switch to next voice
5. Compare side-by-side
6. **Pick best combo** ✅

## 💬 **TEST 4: Conversation Flow** (20 minutes, £0)

### **Full Conversation Simulation:**

Pretend you're the lead and have a FULL conversation:

```
AI: [Opening]
You: "Hi, who is this?"

AI: [Explains]
You: "How much does it cost?"

AI: [Handles objection]
You: "I'm not sure, I need to think about it"

AI: [Overcomes objection]
You: "Okay, maybe I'm interested"

AI: [Closes for appointment]
You: "Alright, let's book something"

AI: [Calendar booking]
```

### **What to Look For:**
- ✅ Natural flow (not robotic)
- ✅ Handles interruptions smoothly
- ✅ Doesn't repeat itself
- ✅ Closes confidently
- ✅ You'd actually book if you were a real lead

### **Red Flags:**
- ❌ Sounds scripted/robotic
- ❌ Ignores your objections
- ❌ Too pushy or aggressive
- ❌ Unclear on next steps
- ❌ You'd hang up if you were real lead

**If you find red flags:** Adjust script, test again (still free!)

**Time:** 20 minutes  
**Cost:** £0  
**Result:** Smooth, natural conversation

## 🎓 **TESTING BEST PRACTICES**

### **Do's:**
- ✅ Test one variable at a time (don't change 3 things at once)
- ✅ Take notes immediately (memory fades fast)
- ✅ Be honest (would YOU book from this call?)
- ✅ Test with realistic scenarios (don't be too nice)
- ✅ Compare versions side-by-side

### **Don'ts:**
- ❌ Test when tired (you'll approve mediocre scripts)
- ❌ Test too many versions (decision fatigue after 10)
- ❌ Skip note-taking ("I'll remember" = you won't)
- ❌ Test in noisy environment (can't hear properly)
- ❌ Be overly critical (leads aren't perfect either)

## 💡 **PRO TIPS**

### **Tip 1: Record Your Browser Tests**
```
Use Windows Game Bar (Win + G) or QuickTime (Mac)
to record your browser tests.

Watch them back later to catch things you missed.
```

### **Tip 2: Test at Different Times**
```
Test in morning (fresh perspective)
Test in afternoon (normal energy)
Test in evening (tired = more realistic lead state)

Scripts that work when you're tired = scripts that work on real leads
```

### **Tip 3: Phone a Friend**
```
Put the browser test on speaker
Have a friend listen
Get their instant feedback
Two perspectives = better script
```

### **Tip 4: The "Would I Buy?" Test**
```
After each test ask:
"If I was a real lead, would I book from that call?"

If answer is "No" or "Maybe" → Keep iterating
If answer is "Hell yes" → You have a winner
```
