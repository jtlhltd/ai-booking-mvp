**The Fix**:
- Added 60-second timeout to `/api/search-google-places` endpoint
- Added proper timeout cleanup in both success and error cases
- Longer timeout than decision-maker endpoint (60s vs 30s) since search is more complex
- Returns 504 timeout instead of 502 crash

**How It Was Done**:
- Added `setTimeout(60000)` to search-google-places endpoint
- Added `clearTimeout(timeout)` in both success and error handlers
- Returns proper 504 timeout response instead of crashing
- 60-second timeout allows for complex search operations

**Result**:
- Main search endpoint won't crash with 502 errors
- Requests timeout gracefully after 60 seconds if needed

- No pagination - just more diverse search terms

**How It Was Done**:
- Added 8 more UK cities to search queries
- Added 6 more mobile-friendly terms
- Each query still returns 20 results (Google limit)
- Total potential results: 20+ queries × 20 results = 400+ businesses
- No server overload from pagination

**Result**:
- Should get 200+ businesses instead of 49
- More diverse results from different cities
- Better mobile number coverage
- No 502 errors (no pagination)
