## [2024-12-19] - Fix Target Mobile Number Achievement
**Status**: üîÑ TESTING

**What Changed**:
- Increased processing multiplier from 1.5x to 10x to reach mobile targets
- Added mobile counting and early stopping when target is reached
- Added detailed logging for mobile number discovery (mobile + landline)
- Enhanced response with target achievement status
- Increased response limit to prevent early stopping

**How It Was Done**:
- Changed `maxProcess` from `maxResults * 1.5` to `maxResults * 10` (increased again)
- Added `mobileCount` tracking variable
- Added early break when `mobileCount >= targetMobileNumbers`
- Added `[MOBILE FOUND]`, `[LANDLINE FOUND]`, and `[TARGET REACHED]` console logs
- Enhanced API response with `targetReached` boolean
- Increased response limit from 5x to 10x to prevent early stopping

**Result**:
- Should now reliably reach the requested number of mobile numbers
- Stops processing as soon as target is reached (efficient)
- Better visibility into mobile number discovery process
- More accurate target achievement reporting

**Files Modified**:
- `server.js` - Enhanced Google Places search logic

**Git Commit**:
- TBD (will commit after testing)
