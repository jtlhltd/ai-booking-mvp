# Lead Generator Changelog

## Version 1.0.0 - Working Base (Current)
**Status**: ✅ WORKING - Finds mobile numbers reliably

### What Works:
- Single search mode only
- Frontend sends `maxResults * 2` to backend
- Backend processes `maxResults * 1.5` results
- Backend stops at `maxResults * 2` limit
- Mobile number detection works
- No 502 errors
- Finds exactly the requested number of mobile leads

### Key Settings:
- Frontend multiplier: `maxResults * 2`
- Backend processing: `maxResults * 1.5`
- Backend limit: `maxResults * 2`
- API timeout: 30 seconds
- Delay between calls: 100ms

## [2024-12-19] - CRITICAL FIX: Remove Processing Limits to Reach Targets
**Status**: 🔄 TESTING

**What Was Wrong**:
- System found 130 businesses but only processed 130 (limited by `maxProcess`)
- `maxProcess = Math.min(allResults.length, maxResults * 20)` was limiting processing
- Safety limits were too low (`maxResults * 50`)
- System stopped processing before reaching mobile targets

**The Fix**:
- Removed artificial processing limit: `maxProcess = allResults.length`
- Increased safety limit from 50x to 100x (`maxResults * 100`)
- System now processes ALL available results until target is reached
- No more early stopping due to processing limits

**How It Was Done**:
- Changed `maxProcess` from `Math.min(allResults.length, maxResults * 20)` to `allResults.length`
- Increased safety limit from `maxResults * 50` to `maxResults * 100`
- Added logging: "Processing ALL X results until target Y mobile numbers is reached"

**Result**:
- System will now process all 130+ businesses instead of stopping early
- Should find 10+ mobile numbers from the available businesses
- No more artificial limits preventing target achievement

**Files Modified**:
- `server.js` - Removed processing limits

**Git Commit**:
- TBD (will commit after testing)

## [2024-12-19] - Alternative Approach: More Search Queries Instead of Pagination
**Status**: 🔄 TESTING

**What Changed**:
- Increased search queries from 6-10 to 20+ queries
- Added more UK cities (London, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Bristol, Newcastle)
- Added more mobile-friendly terms (director, specialist, mobile, personal, individual, freelance)
- No pagination - just more diverse search terms

**How It Was Done**:
- Added 8 more UK cities to search queries
- Added 6 more mobile-friendly terms
- Each query still returns 20 results (Google limit)
- Total potential results: 20+ queries × 20 results = 400+ businesses
- No server overload from pagination

**Result**:
- Should get 200+ businesses instead of 49
- More diverse results from different cities
- Better mobile number coverage
- No 502 errors (no pagination)

**Files Modified**:
- `server.js` - Enhanced search query diversity

**Git Commit**:
- TBD (will commit after testing)

## [2024-12-19] - CRITICAL FIX: Parameter Mismatch Between Frontend and Backend
**Status**: ✅ WORKING (Reverted from pagination 502 error)

**What Was Wrong**:
- User selects "10 mobile numbers" target
- Frontend sends `maxResults * 2` = 20 to backend
- Backend tries to find 20 mobile numbers (not 10!)
- User sees only 3 found, thinks system is broken

**The Fix**:
- Frontend now sends actual target number (`maxResults`) to backend
- Backend uses actual target as `targetMobileNumbers`
- No more 2x multiplier confusion

**How It Was Done**:
- Changed frontend: `maxResults * 2` → `maxResults`
- Backend already correctly uses `maxResults` as `targetMobileNumbers`
- This fixes the core parameter mismatch issue

**Result**:
- When user asks for 10 mobile numbers, backend will try to find exactly 10
- No more confusion about why targets aren't being met
- System should now reliably reach the requested target
- **REVERTED**: Pagination caused 502 errors, back to working version

**Files Modified**:
- `public/decision-maker-finder.html` - Fixed parameter sending

**Git Commit**:
- Reverted to working version after pagination 502 error

**What Was Wrong**:
- User selects "10 mobile numbers" target

## [2024-12-19] - Aggressive Target Achievement Implementation
**Status**: 🔄 TESTING

**What Changed**:
- Implemented dynamic processing that continues until target is reached
- Increased processing limit from 10x to 20x for better target achievement
- Removed response limit that was preventing target achievement
- Added progress logging every 10 businesses processed
- Enhanced success/failure reporting

**How It Was Done**:
- Changed loop condition to `i < maxProcess && mobileCount < targetMobileNumbers`
- Increased `maxProcess` from `maxResults * 10` to `maxResults * 20`
- Removed early response limit (`maxResults * 10`)
- Increased safety limit to `maxResults * 50`
- Added progress tracking and detailed logging

**Result**:
- System will now process up to 20x the target to find mobile numbers
- Continues searching until target is reached or safety limits hit
- Better visibility into search progress
- Should reliably reach targets like 10, 25, 50 mobile numbers

**Files Modified**:
- `server.js` - Dynamic processing and aggressive target achievement

**Git Commit**:
- TBD (will commit after testing)

## [2024-12-19] - Smart Google Places Filtering for Mobile Numbers
**Status**: 🔄 TESTING

**What Changed**:
- Enhanced search queries with more mobile-friendly terms (private, consultant, advisor, independent, solo, owner)
- Added mobile likelihood scoring system for businesses
- Implemented smart prioritization - process most promising businesses first
- Added mobile likelihood score to business objects

**How It Was Done**:
- Added more mobile-friendly search terms: 'independent', 'solo', 'owner'
- Created mobile likelihood scoring (1-9 scale) based on business name patterns
- Sorted results by mobile likelihood before processing
- Consultants/Advisors: 9/10, Solo/Private: 8/10, Clinics: 6/10, Groups: 3/10

**Result**:
- Should find mobile numbers faster and more efficiently
- Processes most promising businesses first (saves credits)
- Better targeting of decision-makers with mobile numbers
- More accurate mobile likelihood assessment
