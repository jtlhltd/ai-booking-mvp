## [2024-12-19] - CRITICAL FIX: Reduce Processing Load to Prevent Server Crashes
**Status**: 🔄 TESTING

**What Was Wrong**:
- Server still crashing with 502 errors despite timeout protection
- Processing too many businesses (300) was overwhelming the server
- Too many search queries (20+) were causing memory issues
- Safety limits were too high (100x, 10,000 businesses)

**The Fix**:
- Reduced processing limit from 300 to 50 businesses (very conservative)
- Reduced search queries from 20+ to 6 core queries
- Reduced mobile-friendly terms from 15+ to 3 essential terms
- Reduced safety limits from 100x to 20x (maxResults * 20)
- Reduced fallback limit from 10,000 to 1,000 businesses

**How It Was Done**:
- Changed `maxProcess = Math.min(allResults.length, 50)`
- Reduced UK search queries to: UK, London, Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, Edinburgh
- Reduced mobile terms to: "private", "consultant", "independent"
- Changed safety limit to `maxResults * 20`
- Changed fallback limit to `1000` businesses

**Result**:
- Much lighter processing load to prevent server crashes
- Should still find mobile numbers from smaller, focused search
- Server should be stable and not crash with 502 errors
- Conservative approach prioritizes stability over volume

**Files Modified**:
- `server.js` - Reduced processing load and search scope

**Git Commit**:
- TBD (will commit after testing)

## [2024-12-19] - CRITICAL FIX: Add Timeout Protection to Main Search Endpoint
**Status**: 🔄 TESTING

**What Was Wrong**:
- 502 errors on `/api/search-google-places` endpoint (main search API)
- This is different from the decision-maker-contacts endpoint we fixed earlier
- Main search was failing before mobile detection could even run
- No timeout protection on the primary search endpoint

**The Fix**:
- Added 60-second timeout to `/api/search-google-places` endpoint
- Added proper timeout cleanup in both success and error cases
- Longer timeout than decision-maker endpoint (60s vs 30s) since search is more complex
- Returns 504 timeout instead of 502 crash

**How It Was Done**:
- Added `setTimeout(60000)` to search-google-places endpoint
- Added `clearTimeout(timeout)` in both success and error handlers
- Returns proper 504 timeout response instead of crashing
- 60-second timeout allows for complex search operations

**Result**:
- Main search endpoint won't crash with 502 errors
- Requests timeout gracefully after 60 seconds if needed
- Search can now complete and proceed to mobile detection
- Better error handling for the primary search functionality

**Files Modified**:
- `server.js` - Added timeout protection to search-google-places endpoint

**Git Commit**:
- TBD (will commit after testing)

## [2024-12-19] - CRITICAL FIX: Improve Mobile Number Detection and Search Strategy
**Status**: 🔄 TESTING

**What Was Wrong**:
- Only finding 6 mobile numbers from 127 businesses (need 10)
- Mobile number detection might be too strict
- Not processing enough businesses to reach target
- Search queries might not be targeting mobile-friendly businesses

**The Fix**:
- Increased processing limit from 200 to 300 businesses
- Added more mobile-friendly search terms ("direct contact", "mobile number", "cell phone")
- Improved mobile number detection with fallback pattern
- Increased phone number debugging from 10% to 20%
- Added fallback detection for 07xxxxxxxxx pattern

**How It Was Done**:
- Changed `maxProcess = Math.min(allResults.length, 300)`
- Added search terms: "direct contact", "mobile number", "cell phone"
- Added fallback: `cleanPhone.length === 11 && cleanPhone.startsWith('07')`
- Increased debug logging to 20% of phone numbers

**Result**:
- Should process more businesses (up to 300 instead of 200)
- Better mobile number detection with fallback patterns
- More targeted search queries for mobile-friendly businesses
- Better debugging to see what phone numbers are being processed

**Files Modified**:
- `server.js` - Improved mobile detection and search strategy

**Git Commit**:
- TBD (will commit after testing)

## [2024-12-19] - CRITICAL FIX: Prevent 502 Errors with Timeout and Safety Limits
**Status**: 🔄 TESTING

**What Was Wrong**:
- Server was crashing with 502 errors when processing too many businesses
- No timeout protection on the decision-maker-contacts endpoint
- Processing all 130+ businesses at once was overwhelming the server

**The Fix**:
- Added 30-second timeout to prevent hanging requests
- Limited processing to max 200 businesses (safety limit)
- Added proper timeout cleanup in success and error cases
- Server now returns 504 timeout instead of 502 crash

**How It Was Done**:
- Added `setTimeout(30000)` to decision-maker-contacts endpoint
- Changed `maxProcess = Math.min(allResults.length, 200)` 
- Added `clearTimeout(timeout)` in both success and error handlers
- Returns proper 504 timeout response instead of crashing

**Result**:
- Server won't crash with 502 errors
- Requests timeout gracefully after 30 seconds
- Still processes up to 200 businesses (should be enough for 10 mobile targets)
- Better error handling and user feedback

**Files Modified**:
- `server.js` - Added timeout protection and safety limits

**Git Commit**:
- TBD (will commit after testing)

## [2024-12-19] - CRITICAL FIX: Remove Processing Limits to Reach Targets
**Status**: 🔄 TESTING

**What Was Wrong**:
- System found 130 businesses but only processed 130 (limited by `maxProcess`)
- `maxProcess = Math.min(allResults.length, maxResults * 20)` was limiting processing
- Safety limits were too low (`maxResults * 50`)
- System stopped processing before reaching mobile targets

**The Fix**:
- Removed artificial processing limit: `maxProcess = allResults.length`
- Increased safety limit from 50x to 100x (`maxResults * 100`)
- System now processes ALL available results until target is reached
- No more early stopping due to processing limits

**How It Was Done**:
- Changed `maxProcess` from `Math.min(allResults.length, maxResults * 20)` to `allResults.length`
- Increased safety limit from `maxResults * 50` to `maxResults * 100`
- Added logging: "Processing ALL X results until target Y mobile numbers is reached"

**Result**:
- System will now process all 130+ businesses instead of stopping early
- Should find 10+ mobile numbers from the available businesses
- No more artificial limits preventing target achievement

**Files Modified**:
- `server.js` - Removed processing limits

**Git Commit**:
- TBD (will commit after testing)

## [2024-12-19] - Alternative Approach: More Search Queries Instead of Pagination
**Status**: 🔄 TESTING

**What Changed**:
- Increased search queries from 6-10 to 20+ queries
- Added more UK cities (London, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Bristol, Newcastle)
- Added more mobile-friendly terms (director, specialist, mobile, personal, individual, freelance)
- No pagination - just more diverse search terms

**How It Was Done**:
- Added 8 more UK cities to search queries
- Added 6 more mobile-friendly terms
- Each query still returns 20 results (Google limit)
- Total potential results: 20+ queries × 20 results = 400+ businesses
- No server overload from pagination

**Result**:
- Should get 200+ businesses instead of 49
- More diverse results from different cities
- Better mobile number coverage
- No 502 errors (no pagination)

**Files Modified**:
- `server.js` - Enhanced search query diversity

**Git Commit**:
- TBD (will commit after testing)

## [2024-12-19] - CRITICAL FIX: Parameter Mismatch Between Frontend and Backend
**Status**: ✅ WORKING (Reverted from pagination 502 error)

**What Was Wrong**:
- User selects "10 mobile numbers" target
- Frontend sends `maxResults * 2` = 20 to backend
- Backend tries to find 20 mobile numbers (not 10!)
- User sees only 3 found, thinks system is broken

**The Fix**:
- Frontend now sends actual target number (`maxResults`) to backend
- Backend uses actual target as `targetMobileNumbers`
- No more 2x multiplier confusion

**How It Was Done**:
- Changed frontend: `maxResults * 2` → `maxResults`
- Backend already correctly uses `maxResults` as `targetMobileNumbers`
- This fixes the core parameter mismatch issue

**Result**:
- When user asks for 10 mobile numbers, backend will try to find exactly 10
- No more confusion about why targets aren't being met
- System should now reliably reach the requested target
- **REVERTED**: Pagination caused 502 errors, back to working version

**Files Modified**:
- `public/decision-maker-finder.html` - Fixed parameter sending
