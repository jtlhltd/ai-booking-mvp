# 📱 Decision Maker Mobile Finder Workflow

## 🎯 How It Works (2-Step Process)

Your system now uses a **dedicated mobile finder** that searches multiple sources for decision maker mobile numbers:

### **Step 1: Find Businesses**
Search Google Places for businesses

### **Step 2: Find Owner's Mobile** (NEW!)
For each business, search:
- ✅ **Companies House** - UK company directors
- ✅ **LinkedIn** - Business owner profiles
- ✅ **Company Website** - Team/contact pages
- ✅ **Google Search** - Public contact info

---

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

```bash
node find-and-call-leads.js "dental practices in London"
```

**What happens:**
1. 🔍 Finds 20-50 businesses
2. 📱 Searches for each owner's mobile number
3. ✅ Returns only businesses where mobile found
4. 📞 Calls them automatically

---

## 📊 **Expected Results**

**Traditional Search (business phone only):**
- 50 businesses found
- 80% have landlines (receptionists)
- 20% have mobiles
- **Result: 10 callable mobiles**

**With Decision Maker Finder:**
- 50 businesses found
- Search for owner's mobile for each
- Find mobiles for 30-40% of owners

## 🔍 **Data Sources Used**

### **1. Companies House** (Most Reliable)
- Searches UK company registrations
- Gets director names from official records
- Searches for director mobile numbers

**Example:**
```
Business: "Smith Dental Practice Ltd"
→ Companies House: Dr. John Smith (Director)
→ Search: "Dr. John Smith Smith Dental mobile"
→ Find: 07123 456789
```

### **2. LinkedIn**
- Searches for business owner profiles
- Extracts contact info from profiles
- Looks for "Owner", "Director", "Managing Partner"

### **3. Company Website**
- Scrapes team/about pages
- Looks for owner contact info
- Finds mobile numbers listed publicly

### **4. Google Search**
- Combines business name + owner name
- Searches for contact listings
- Finds public directories

## ⚙️ **Configuration**

Add these API keys to `.env` for best results:

```bash
# Companies House (UK company data)
COMPANIES_HOUSE_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Google Custom Search (for web scraping)
GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_key_here
GOOGLE_SEARCH_CX=your_search_engine_id

# Optional: LinkedIn API (higher quality data)
LINKEDIN_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

**Without API keys:** Still works but finds fewer mobiles (only public data)

```

Newer businesses are more likely to list mobiles publicly

```bash
# Instead of:
"dental practice in London"

# Try:
"private dentist in London"
"cosmetic dentistry in London"
"dental surgery in London"
```

### **4. Use Specific Areas**

"dentist in London"

# Use specific:
"dentist in Camden London"

```
